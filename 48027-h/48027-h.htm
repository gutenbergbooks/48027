<h2>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>


<p>The Deed of Foundation of the Shaw Fellowship provides
that "it shall be in the power of the Senatus
Academicus of the University of Edinburgh to require
the holder of the Shaw Philosophical Fellowship,
during the fourth or fifth year of his tenure of
it, to deliver in the University of Edinburgh a course
of Lectures, not exceeding four, on any of the subjects
for the encouragement of the study of which the Fellowship
has been founded." The following pages
consist of four lectures delivered in the University of
Edinburgh, in accordance with this provision, in the
month of January 1884.</p>

<p>Since their delivery, the argument of the lectures
has been revised, and in some places enlarged. I have
also thought it better to modify their original form by
dividing the discussion into chapters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>ETHICS AND ITS PROBLEMS.</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">1. Connection
of ethics
with theoretical
philosophy.</div>


<p>It is a common remark that a writer's ethical
doctrine is throughout conditioned by his attitude
to the problems of theoretical philosophy. The
main lines of dispute in questions of ethics may
be regarded as prolongations of the controversies
which arise in metaphysics and psychology. The
Realism or Idealism which marks a speculative
system reappears in its ethics, whilst differences
in the psychological analysis of mental states, or
concerning the relation of pleasure to desire, are
grounds of distinction between schools of moralists.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>a</i>) Dependence
of ethical on theoretical points of
view<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
And not only are the special controversies of ethics
decided in different ways, but the scope of the
whole science is differently conceived, as the speculative
standpoint changes. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>a</i>) teleological,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Thus, not for one
school only, but for a whole period in the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of reflection, ethics was regarded as an inquiry
into the highest human good. Opposed schools
agreed in looking from this point of view, however
much they might differ from one another in defining
the nature of that highest good. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>b</i>) jural,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
At other times,
according to the prevailing view, to investigate and
systematise the rules of conduct has exhausted
the scope of ethics&mdash;controversies being carried
on as to the nature of those rules, and their source
in external authority or in the internal revelation
of conscience. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>c</i>) empirical:<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Again, ethical inquiry has been
apparently identified with the analysis and history
of the moral affections and sentiments; while a
purely external point of view seems to be sometimes
adopted, and ethics held to be an investigation
of the historical results of action, and of the
forms, customary and institutional, in which those
results find permanent expression.</p>


<p>These different ways of looking at the whole
subject proceed from points of view whose effects
are not confined to ethics, but may be followed
out in other lines of investigation. They correspond
to ideas which dominate different types of
thought and form different philosophical standpoints.
The first starts from a teleological conception
of human nature, as an organism consciously
striving towards its end. The second
assimilates ethics to a system of legal enactments,
and is connected with the jural conceptions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
theology and law. The two last are concerned
to show that the subject-matter of ethics are facts
which have to be treated by the ordinary inductive
and historical methods. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>to be connected
by
philosophy.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
These different points of
view, however, are to be regarded as complementary
rather than as conflicting, although their complete
synthesis must be worked out in the region
of general philosophy, and not on purely ethical
ground. Philosophy has thus to deal with the
notions which determine the scope and character
of ethical thought; and in this way it must necessarily
pass from the purely speculative to the
practical point of view. If it is the business of
philosophy to bring into rational order the material
supplied by experience, cosmical and anthropological,
it cannot be without bearing on the function
of man as a source of action in the world.
The question, What are the ends man is naturally
fitted to attain? or&mdash;if we prefer so to express it&mdash;What
are the ends he ought to pursue? is not
merely as natural as the question, What can a man
know of the world and of himself? But the two
questions are inseparably connected. To know
man is to know him not only as a thinking but
also as an active being; while to solve the problem
of the ends of man implies knowledge both of his
nature and of the sphere of his activity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) Ethics
necessary to complete
philosophy.</div>


<p>Much distrust is often expressed of metaphysics.
But it is not denied that the philosophy&mdash;whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
metaphysical or not&mdash;in which our most comprehensive
view of the world finds its reasoned expression,
cannot neglect that aspect of things in
which man is related to his surroundings as a
source of action. Recent ethical literature is itself
a proof of this fact. In its speculative developments,
both realistic and idealistic, the philosophy
of the present day has made the endeavour to connect
its conceptions of the world of thought and
nature with the ends contemplated as to be realised
in the realm of action. Whatever difficulties may
be involved in the transition from the "is" to the
"ought to be," it is yet implied that the transition
requires to be made, not merely in order that
human activity may be shown to be rational, but
that reason itself may be justified by leaving
nothing outside its sphere.</p>

<p>We must make no attempt, therefore, to draw
a line of absolute separation between the first two
of the three questions in which, as Kant says,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> all
the interests of our reason centre. The "What
ought I to do?" of ethics is for ever falling back
on the "What can I know?" of metaphysics. The
question of practice must accordingly be treated
throughout in connection with the question of
knowledge. If we use Kant's distinction between
speculative and practical reason, we must always
bear in mind that it is the same reason which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in one reference speculative, in another practical.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
We are not at liberty to assume with Butler<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that
"morality ... must be somewhat plain and
easy to be understood: it must appeal to what we
call common-sense." Nor may we presuppose, as
Hutcheson did,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that it is a subject "about which
a little reflection will discover the truth." The
question must be looked upon not so much as one
of immediate practical as of scientific interest, and
reason is to be regarded as the only court of
appeal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. The inquiry
into
the ethical
end</div>


<p>The form just quoted, in which Kant states the
problem, is not altogether free from ambiguity.
"What ought I to do?" may be taken to signify,
What means should I adopt for the attainment of
some end presupposed, perhaps unconsciously, as
the end to be sought? But it is evident, not only
that this is not what Kant himself meant by the
question, but that, as thus put, it necessarily implies
a further and deeper question. Not the discovery
of the means, but the determination of the
end itself&mdash;the end which cannot be interpreted
as a mere means to some further end&mdash;is the
fundamental question of ethics. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>a</i>) fundamental,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It is only by
misconception that this can be thought to be a
trivial question. To say, as a recent scientific
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
writer does,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "that happiness in one disguise or
another is the end of human life is common ground
for all the schools," is either to ignore what the
schools have taught,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or else to use the word
"happiness" merely as another name for the
highest good. But, even were it still the case, as
it was in the time of Aristotle, that nearly all men
were agreed as to the name of the highest good,
and that the common people and the cultured alike
called it happiness, the difference as to what they
meant by the term would still remain. To say
that the ethical end is happiness is, to use Locke's
terminology, a "trifling proposition"; for in so
doing we merely give it a name<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;and one which
the controversies of philosophy have surrounded
with confusion. That the end is happiness in any
definite sense, for example, as the greatest balance
of pleasure over pain, <em>may</em> be perfectly true, but
stands very much in need of proof. That happiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>is the highest ethical end can be assumed as
true only when "happiness" is nothing more than an
abbreviated expression for "the highest ethical end."</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) implies a
new point of
view,</div>

<p>A difficulty of a more radical kind meets us, at
the very outset of our inquiry, in the distinctively
ethical notion expressed by the word "ought."
Various attempts have been made to surmount or
circumvent this difficulty; and some of these will
come under consideration in the sequel. The very
notion of conscious activity contains the idea of
bringing about something which does not yet exist.
It involves a purpose or end. The notion "ought,"
it is true, means more than this: it implies an
obligation to pursue a definite end or conform to
definite rules, regarded generally as coming from
an authoritative source. In this clear and full
sense, "oughtness" or duty is a comparatively
recent notion, foreign to the classical period of
Greek ethics. The force and definiteness belonging
to the modern conception of it are due to the
juridical aspect which the Stoic philosophy, Roman
law, and Christian theology combined to impress
upon morality. But even the notion of purpose or
end implies a "preference" of the end sought: the
state to be realised is looked upon as "better" or
"more to be desired" than the existing state. We
may ask for the reason of this superior desirableness;
but the answer must soon fall back upon the
assertion of something held to be desirable in itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
The question which we are always asking,
and cannot help asking, "Why is such and such an
end to be pursued by me?" or "Why ought I to
follow such and such a course of conduct?" must
soon lead to the assertion of an ultimate end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">the transition
to which
requires investigation;</div>

<p>This end, therefore, must not be sought for some
ulterior end, nor desired as a means to satisfy any
other desire. But it is still necessary to inquire
into the way in which the end, held to be ultimate
in a practical regard, stands related to the constitution
of man and his environment. And the
question to which I would draw attention, as the
fundamental problem of ethics, is, What is that
which men have variously called happiness, the
highest good, the ethical end? or, more precisely,
How can a transition be made from the notions of
theoretical philosophy to the determination of that
ethical end? No assumption is made, at starting,
as to the nature of this end, or the manner of
arriving at it. It may be a transient state of feeling,
or a permanent type of character; or it may
by its very nature defy exact definition,&mdash;the idea
itself being perfected as its realisation is progressively
approached. In any case it requires to be
brought into connection with the ultimate conceptions
of thought and existence.</p>

<p>This question of the ethical end <em>or</em> highest good
is thus fundamental in ethical science, and upon it
all other questions in ethics finally depend. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it is easy to see that it does not cover the whole
field, and that the other points of view already
referred to have a legitimate application. Ethics
has not only to determine the end, but to apply it
to practice, and so to decide as to what is right or
wrong in particular actions, and virtuous or vicious
in character. And, in addition to the two questions
thus implied&mdash;the question as to the ethical end,
and that as to the application of it to practical
affairs&mdash;there is another department of inquiry
which has had a place assigned to it in most ethical
systems, and which has a right to be regarded
as belonging to ethics. We may investigate the
place, in the individual and the community respectively,
both of the sentiments and ideas and of the
social institutions and customs through which morality
is manifested; and this inquiry covers the
twofold ground of what may be called moral psychology
and moral sociology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) distinct
from other
ethical
questions:</div>

<p>Of these three questions, the first forms the subject
of inquiry in the following pages. It seems to
me that a great part of the obscurity which surrounds
ethical argument is due to confounding these
different questions. It is true that no one of them
is without bearing on the others; but it is none the
less necessary, in discussing any one of them, to
keep its distinctness from those others well in view.
In inquiring into the foundation on which the ethical
end is based, I do not intend to develop a code<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of rules for practical conduct or a theory of human
virtue; nor shall I attempt to trace the origin and
nature of moral sentiments and ideas, or of the
social institutions and customs connected with morality.
If these subjects have to be introduced at all,
it will be only in so far as they may be thought to
decide, or tend to decide, the question more immediately
in view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(α) from inquiry
into
the methods
of ethics.</div>

<p>Thus it forms no part of the present inquiry to
follow out the application to conduct of different
ethical ends, or to exhibit the different practical
systems to which different ends naturally lead. It
might seem indeed, at first sight, as if the development
of their practical consequences might solve
the question as to the nature of the ends themselves.
If we assume certain possible and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ
facie</i> reasonable ethical ends, and then see what
codes of morality they will yield, surely (it may be
thought) that one which affords the most consistent
and harmonious code for the guidance of life
will be the end to be sought in preference to
all others. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Limitation
of this
inquiry<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But in order that the criticism of what
Professor Sidgwick has called the methods of ethics
may be able to answer the question as to the end
or principle of ethics, certain conditions must first
be complied with. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>aa</i>) from
necessity of
investigating
all logical
alternatives,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In the first place, it is necessary
that the ends or principles whose applications to
conduct are to be examined must not be uncritically
accepted from the fluctuating morality of common-sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
nor from the commonplaces of the
schools, but must be shown to be "alternatives
between which the human mind" is "necessarily
forced to choose when it attempts to frame a complete
synthesis of practical maxims, and to act in a
perfectly rational manner."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>bb</i>) from
more than
one self-consistent
code
being
possible,</div>

<p>But although this requisite is complied with, it
will still remain possible, in the second place, that
two or more of the assumed principles may yield
systems of practical rules perfectly self-consistent,
and yet inconsistent with one another.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It would
be very hard indeed to show that both the theory
of Egoistic Hedonism, and what is generally called
Utilitarianism, do not succeed in doing so: and thus
the examination of methods is not of itself sufficient
to settle the question of the end of conduct.
And since&mdash;to quote Mr Sidgwick<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;it is "a fundamental
postulate of ethics that either these
methods must be reconciled and harmonised, or all
but one of them rejected," it follows that the criticism
of methods leads naturally up to an independent
criticism of principles, unless indeed it can be
shown that one method only yields a consistent
code of practical rules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">(<i>cc</i>) from its
assumption
that the true
end must
give perfectly
consistent rules.</div>

<p>Even in this case, however, if it led to the adoption
of the end in question, it must be borne in
mind that the postulate would be implied that the
true ethical end must be able to yield a consistent
and harmonious system of rules for practical life.
Without altogether denying this postulate, it yet
seems to me that it stands in need of qualification.
For in different circumstances, and at different
stages of individual and social development, the
application of the same ethical end may naturally
produce different and conflicting courses of conduct.
We must not start with any such assumption as
that the rationality of the end consists in some sort
of mathematical equality which ignores alike the
different environment with which one age and another
surround different generations, and the different
functions which one individual and another
have to perform in the social whole. We must
leave open the possibility that what is right now
may be wrong in another age; we must remember
that everybody may not count for one, and that
some people may count for more than one; we
must admit that we may have sometimes to do to
others what we would not that others should do
to us. The only consistency we have a right to
demand must leave room for such a variety of different
conditions as to be, by itself, a very insecure
guide.</p>

<p>From the difficulty of complying with the above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
conditions, it seems practically impossible for the
criticism of ethical methods to decide the question
of the ethical end. Even if the application to conduct
of every important end has been taken account
of, we are met with the difficulty that two or more
mutually antagonistic though self-consistent practical
codes may probably have been developed,
while we are not even justified in assuming that
inability to yield a system which will fit the complex
circumstances of life in a perfectly harmonious
manner is sufficient ground for rejecting an end
shown in some other way to be reasonable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(β) distinct
from moral
psychology
and sociology.</div>

<p>The last department of ethics referred to&mdash;that
which has to do with the origin and nature of moral
sentiments and social customs&mdash;has a bearing on
the question of the end of conduct in some respects
more important than the investigation of ethical
methods. For, whereas the latter expressly assumes
certain ends as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ facie</i> reasonable, the former
inquiry, on the contrary, is now frequently understood
to be able, without presupposing any ethical
relations whatever, to trace the way in which, from
primitive feelings and customs, morality itself has
been evolved. The psychological side of ethical
inquiry has always had an important place with
English moralists. At times, indeed, the question
of the "moral faculty" has excited so much
interest as to divert attention from the nature of
morality itself. Moral truth has been supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
be something known and indisputable, the only
question being how we came to know it. But the
psychology of ethics, reinforced by the knowledge
sociology gives of the development of morality,
rises now to larger issues. It attempts to show
the genesis of the moral from the non-moral, to
account thus for the origin of ethical ideas, and
even to determine what kinds of ends are to be
striven after. In this way, a theory of the origin
and growth of moral sentiments and institutions is
made to render important help to more than one
of the theories which will fall to be considered in
the sequel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Present
inquiry
limited</div>


<p>The present Essay has to inquire into the way in
which we may determine what the end of human
conduct is,&mdash;into the basis of ethics, therefore. But
I do not propose to offer an exhaustive investigation
of all the theories which have been or may be
started in solution of the problem. On the contrary,
I will begin by excluding from the inquiry
all theories which seek the basis of ethics in something
outside the constitution of man as a feeling
and reasoning agent:<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> not because I contend that all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>such theories are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ facie</i> unreasonable, but because
it is at any rate the more obvious course to
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>to theories
depending
on the
human constitution,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
seek to determine the function of an organism by
studying its inner constitution, than by having regard
to something which is external to it, and does
not act upon and modify it as a necessary part of
its environment. It is only when this method has
been tried and has failed that we should seek outside
us for some guide as to the part we ought to
play in the universe. For this reason I shall not
take into consideration the views of the basis of
ethics which find it in positive law either divine
or human, except in so far as they are shown to
follow from the nature of man. It is not necessary
for me to deny that the source of all moral obligation
may be the will of God, or the commands of
the sovereign, or the opinion of society, and that
the highest moral ideal may be obedience to such a
rule. But theories of this kind make ethics merely
an application of positive theology, or of legislation,
or of social sentiment, and seem only to have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
appropriate place when we have failed to find an
independent basis for action.</p>

<p>The question which remains to be put may be
expressed in these terms: Can we find in human
nature (taken either alone or in connection with its
environment) any indications of the end of human
conduct, or, in other words, of the principle on
which human beings "ought" to act? and if so, in
what direction do these indications point, and what
is their significance? The answer to this question
will thus necessarily depend on the view we take
of the constitution of man and his relation to his
environment. And I purpose to bring this discussion
within the necessary limits by considering
the ethical consequences of one only of the
two views into which philosophical opinion is
divided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and here to
ethics of
Naturalism,</div>


<p>Now the fundamental principle of division in
philosophical opinion lies in the place assigned to
reason in human nature.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> According to one theory,
man is essentially a sensitive subject, though able
to reason about his sensations&mdash;that is, to associate,
compound, and compare them. He is supposed to
be built up of sense-presentations associated with
feelings of pleasure and pain. Recipient of external
impressions which persist in idea and are accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>by pleasure or pain on his part, and thus
followed by other ideas and impressions, man's
mental constitution is explained without attributing
to reason any spontaneous or productive
function.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>as distinguished
from Rational
ethics.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The other view differs from this in
attributing spontaneity to reason&mdash;making it, in
one way or another, the source of forms of thought,
principles, or ideas. The former may be called the
Naturalistic, the latter the Rationalistic view of
man: from that follows a Naturalistic or Natural
ethics, from this a Rationalistic or Rational ethics.
Into both these theories, in a theoretical as well as
in an ethical aspect, the historical turn of thought
which has characterised recent inquiry has introduced
a profound modification. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Naturalism
either individualistic<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
On the basis of
Naturalism, we may either look upon man as an
individual distinct from other individuals, as was
done by Epicurus and Hobbes and the materialists
of the eighteenth century, or we may consider the
race as itself an organism, <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>or historical.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
apart from which the
individual is unintelligible, and look upon human
nature as having become what it now is through a
long process of interaction between organism and
environment, in which social as well as psychical
and physical facts have influenced the result. This
is the view to the elaboration of which Comte and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Darwin and Spencer have in different ways contributed.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
What makes the historical method of
importance philosophically, is not the mere fact
that it traces a sequence of events in time, but the
fact that, by doing so, it is able to look upon each
link in the chain of events as necessarily connected
with every other, and thus to regard as
a system&mdash;or, rather, as an organism&mdash;what previous
empirical theories had left without any
principle of unity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rationalism
either individualistic</div>

<p>A similar movement of thought has introduced
a like modification into the Rationalistic theory.
According to older doctrines, the individual reason
is mysteriously charged with certain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i>
principles which are to us laws of knowledge and
of action; whereas the form of Rationalism which
is now in the ascendant resembles the theory of
natural evolution in this, that as the latter finds
the race more real than the individual, and the
individual to exist only in the race, so the former
looks upon the individual reason as but a finite
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>or universalistic.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
manifestation of the universal reason, and attempts
to show the principles or constitutive elements of
this universal reason or consciousness in their
logical or necessary connection&mdash;leaving open to
empirical investigation the way in which they
have gradually disclosed themselves in the individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>human subject, and in the expression of
the collective life of the race. Thus, as Natural
Ethics is divided into an individualistic and an
historical view, a similar distinction might be
made in Rational Ethics, though in this case it
would be more difficult to follow out the distinction
in detail; and many ethical systems cannot
be said to have kept consistently either to one
side of it or to the other.</p>

<p>In the following discussion I shall investigate
the ethical theory which is founded on the basis of
Naturalism&mdash;working out and criticising in somewhat
greater detail that form of the theory which,
from the agreement it lays claim to with the results
of modern science, plays so important a part in
contemporary philosophical thought.</p>

THE INDIVIDUALISTIC THEORY.</p>


<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>EGOISM.</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Definition of
Naturalism.</div>

<p>It is difficult to give an exact definition or even
description of what I have called the "natural"
view of man. Perhaps it may be best defined,
negatively, as the view which denies to reason any
spontaneous or creative function in the human
constitution. For this definition, if it still leaves
the positive description wanting, will at least
make the classification into "natural" and "rational"
exhaustive and mutually exclusive. At
the same time it is to be noted that, on the theory
of Naturalism, reason is not supposed to be excluded
from all share in determining questions of
conduct or the choice of ends. It would, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
be impossible to have even the pretence of an
ethical theory without a certain use of reason.
But its function, in this case, is limited to the
merely formal one of bringing different presentations
(or objects) and feelings into connection,
and comparing the different states of mind thus
formed with one another, not with a reason-given
standard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Psychological
hedonism.</div>

<p>Since the function of reason is thus restricted,
and its competency to supply an end for, or principle
of, action is denied, we must seek this end
either in the feelings of pleasure and pain which
accompany both sensory and motor presentations,&mdash;perceptions,
that is to say, and actions,&mdash;or in the
more complex, or apparently more complex, emotions
of the mind. And the latter may either be
themselves reducible to feelings of pleasure or pain
accompanying presentations directly pleasurable or
painful, and thence transferred by association to
other presentations, or they may be regarded as
somehow motives to action which may be or ought
to be followed on their own account. The Individualistic
Theory, therefore, is not necessarily
hedonistic. It admits of a twofold view of the
"natural" man: one which looks upon him as in
essence a pleasure-seeking, pain-avoiding animal;
another which regards him as having a variety of
impulses, some of which are not directed to his own
pleasure or avoidance of pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Its theory
of action</div>

<p>The former view&mdash;psychological hedonism, as it
is called&mdash;claims to be an exhaustive analysis of
the motives of human conduct, perfectly general
indeed, but yet valid for every case of action. It
denies the possibility of a man acting from any
other principle than desire of pleasure or aversion
from pain. The theory is, that it is a psychological
law that action is motived by pleasure and pain,
and that nothing else has motive-power over it.
If, then, one pleasure (or avoidance of pain) is
chosen in preference to another, it must be either
by chance,&mdash;an alternative which has no ethical
significance&mdash;no significance, that is, for the guidance
of voluntary conduct,&mdash;or because the one
course promises, or seems to promise, the attainment
of a greater balance of pleasure than the
other, or is actually at the time more pleasant than
that other. Thus the view that pleasure is the
<em>only</em> motive of human action is really identical, for
ethical purposes, with the theory loosely expressed
in the law that action follows the <em>greatest</em> pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>ambiguous,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
I say "loosely expressed"; for the law as thus
stated really admits of three quite <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>referring to<span class="hidev">|</span></span>different interpretations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
not always distinguished with the
precision which such subjects require.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) actual
consequences
of
action,</div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In the first place, the law might mean that
action always follows the course which, as a matter
of fact, will in the long-run bring the greatest
balance of pleasure to the agent. It is evident
that there is no ground in psychology for maintaining
this view. Yet it is a fair interpretation
of the "law" of psychological hedonism, as
commonly stated; and it is at least an admissible
supposition that this meaning of the phrase has
not been without effect upon the uses to which
the law has been put by some of its upholders.
The second interpretation of the law&mdash;namely (<i>b</i>),
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>or (<i>b</i>) its expected
consequences,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
that action is always in the direction which seems
to the agent most likely to bring him the greatest
balance of pleasure, whether it actually brings it or
not&mdash;is the sense in which it appears to have been
most commonly taken when expressed with any
degree of accuracy. It is in this sense that&mdash;in
language which ascribes greater consistency to
men's conduct than it usually displays&mdash;"interest"
is asserted by the author of the 'Système de la
nature' to be "the sole motive of human action."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
The same view is adopted by Bentham;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and both
James Mill and John Stuart Mill identify desire
with pleasure, or an "idea" of pleasure, in terms
which are sufficiently sweeping, if not very carefully
weighed;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> while the will is said to follow
desire, or only to pass out of its power when
coming under the sway of habit.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Still another
meaning may, however, be given to the "law" of
psychological hedonism, according to which the
doubtful reference to the manifold pleasures and
pains, contemplated as resulting from an action, is
got rid of, and (<i>c</i>)<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>or (<i>c</i>) its present
characteristics.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
the agent is asserted always to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>choose that action or forbearance which is actually
most pleasant, or least painful, to him at the time&mdash;taking
account, of course, of imaginative pleasures
and pains, as well as of those which are immediately
connected with the senses. It is in this
interpretation of its law that psychological hedonism
seems to be most capable of defence, and in this
sense it has been more than once stated and
defended.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Ethical
inferences
from this
theory,</div>

<p>The ethics of the form of Naturalism which is
now under examination must be inferred from the
"law" that human action follows the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>pleasure, in one or other of the above meanings
which that law admits of. The law is the datum or
premiss from which we are to advance to an ethical
conclusion. The "right" is to be evolved from
the pleasurable; and the pleasurable, consequently,
cannot be made to depend upon the right. It is
certainly true of the conduct of most men, "that
our prospect of pleasure resulting from any course
of conduct may largely depend on our conception
of it as right or otherwise."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> But this presupposes
that there is a right independent of one's own
pleasure, and therefore does not apply to an ethics
based on the simple theory of human nature put
forward by psychological hedonism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) in its first
meaning,</div>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to discuss the first alternative
(<i>a</i>), as no psychologist would seriously maintain
it. A society composed of men constituted
in the way it supposes men to be constituted, would
be a collection of rational egoists, omniscient in
all that concerned the results of action, and each
adopting unerringly at every moment the course
of conduct which would increase his own pleasure
the most. The conduct of any member of such a
society could only be modified when&mdash;and would
always be modified when&mdash;the modified conduct
actually brought pleasurable results to the agent:
never so as to make him prefer the public good
to his own. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>b</i>)in its
second meaning:<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The second alternative (<i>b</i>) admits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>such modification taking place only when it seems
to the individual that this modified action will
produce a greater balance of pleasure or smaller
balance of pain than any other course of action.
Under this theory an individual might indeed
prefer the public good or another man's good to
his own, but only through his being deceived as to
the actual results of his course of action. Ethics
as determining an end for conduct is put out of
court; though the statesman or the educator may
modify the actions of others by providing appropriate
motives. If the "two sovereign masters,
pain and pleasure," "determine what we shall do,"
it is hardly necessary for them also "to point out
what we ought to do."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The end is already given
in the nature of action, though an enlightened
understanding will teach men how the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>private
ethics and legislation,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
balance of pleasure may be obtained. We can
only get at a rule prescribing an end by changing
our point of view from the individual to the state.
It is best for the state that each individual should
aim at the common happiness; but, when we talk
of this as a moral duty for the individual, all we
can mean is that the state will punish a breach of
it. In the words of Helvétius,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> "pain and pleasure
are the bonds by which we can always unite personal
interest to the interest of the nation....
The sciences of morals and legislation can be only
deductions from this simple principle." According
to Bentham's psychology, a man is necessitated by
his mental and physical nature to pursue at every
moment, not the greatest happiness of the greatest
number, but what seems to him his own greatest
happiness. And what the legislator has to do is,
by judiciously imposed rewards and punishments,
especially the latter, to make it for the greatest
happiness of each to pursue the greatest happiness
of all.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> As distinguished from this "art of legislation,"
"private ethics" consists only of prudential
rules prescribing the best means to an end predetermined
by nature as the only possible end of
human action: it "teaches how each man may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>dispose himself to pursue the course most conducive
to his own happiness."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The consequences to the
theory of action of the third alternative <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>c</i>) in its
third meaning.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
(<i>c</i>) are
similar: it only states the law with more appearance
of psychological accuracy. If a man always
follows that course of action which will give him
at the time the greatest (real and imaginative)
satisfaction, it is impossible for us to infer from his
nature an ethical law prescribing some other end,
without admitting a fundamental contradiction in
human nature; while to say that he ought to seek
the end he always does and cannot help seeking,
is unnecessary and even unmeaning. Modification
of character may of course be still brought about,
since the kinds of action in which an individual
takes pleasure may be varied almost indefinitely.
But the motive made use of in this educative process
must be personal pleasure; and the end the
legislator has in view in his work must be the
same,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> though it is often quietly assumed that
for him personal pleasure has become identified
with the wider interests of the community.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Result of
this ambiguity,</div>

<p>The different significations of which it admits
show that the psychological law that action follows
the greatest pleasure is by no means so clear as it
may at first sight appear. Probably it is the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>ambiguity of the law that has made it appear to
provide a basis for an ethical system. When it is
said that greatest pleasure is the moral end of
action, this "greatest pleasure" is looked upon as
the greatest possible balance of pleasurable over
painful states for the probable duration of life: on
the egoistic theory, of the life of the individual;
on the utilitarian theory, of the aggregate lives of
all men or even of all sentient beings. But when
it is said that greatest pleasure is, as a matter of
fact, always the motive of action, it is obvious that
"greatest pleasure" has changed its signification.
For if the same meaning were kept to, not only
would the psychological law as thus stated be
openly at variance with facts, but its validity
would render the moral precept unnecessary. It
is even unmeaning to say that a man "ought" to
do that which he always does and cannot help
doing.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> On the other hand, if the double meaning
of the phrase had been clearly stated, we should at
once have seen the hiatus in the <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>ethical
hedonism.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
proof of egoistic
hedonism&mdash;the gap between the present (or apparent)
pleasure for which one does act, and the greatest
pleasure of a lifetime for which one ought to act&mdash;as
well as the additional difficulty of passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>from egoism to utilitarianism. If greatest apparent
pleasure&mdash;or greatest present pleasure&mdash;is by
an inexorable law of human nature always sought,
how can it be shown that we ought to sacrifice the
apparent to the real&mdash;the present pleasure that is
small to the greater future pleasure? If the individual
necessarily pursues his own pleasure, how
can we show that he ought to subordinate it to
the pleasures of the "greatest number"?</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Transition
from psychological
to
ethical
hedonism.
Right action
will imply</div>

<p>It is a matter of fact, however, that the psychologists
who maintain that action follows the greatest
pleasure&mdash;meaning by that, greatest apparent
or greatest present pleasure&mdash;have in their ethics
made the transition to an enlightened Egoism, or
even to Utilitarianism. The nature of the transition
thus requires to be more clearly pointed out.
If the former interpretation of the law of psychological
hedonism could be accepted, and a man's
motive for action were always what seemed to
him likely to bring him the greatest pleasure on
the whole, ethics&mdash;what Bentham calls private
ethics&mdash;could be reduced (as Bentham finally reduces
it) to certain maxims of prudence. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>a</i>) correct
estimate of consequences of
action,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
To be
fully acquainted with the sources of pleasure and
pain, and to estimate them correctly, would imply
possession of the highest (egoistic) morality. If
men could be made to think rightly as to what
their greatest pleasure consisted in, then right
action on their part&mdash;that is to say, the pursuit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
their greatest pleasure&mdash;would (according to Bentham's
psychology) follow as a matter of course.
Right conduct, however, is not so purely an affair
of the intellect as this would make it. Indeed,
Bentham's psychological assumption requires only
to be plainly stated for its inconsistency with the
facts of human action to become apparent. The
"video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor" expresses
too common an experience to be so easily
explained away. The impulses by which action is
governed are not always in accordance with what
the intellect decides to be best on a survey of the
whole life and its varied chances. In judging the
consequences of action, a future good is compared
with a present, regardless of the mere difference of
time by which they are separated. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>b</i>) and corresponding
strength of feeling.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But the springs
which move the will are often at variance with the
decisions of the understanding; and many men are
unable to resist the strength of the impulse to act
for the pleasure of the moment, though they foresee
that a greater future satisfaction would follow
from present self-denial.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, that the facts of experience
are sufficient to show that a man's conduct does not
always follow the course which he thinks likely
to bring him the greatest pleasure on the whole.
But the view that a man always acts for what is
most pleasant&mdash;or least painful&mdash;at the time cannot
be dismissed so easily. It is not enough simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to point to the facts of human action in order to
show that this hypothesis is inconsistent with
them. If we instanced the self-restraint in which
so many pass their lives from day to day, it might
perhaps be answered that there is a persistent idea
of duty, or love of reputation, or fear of social
stigma, the repression of which would be more
painful than the restraint it puts upon other impulses.
Even the martyr who deliberately parts
with life itself for the sake of an ideal, may be said
to choose death as the least painful course open to
him at the time. It should be borne in mind,
however, that Professor Bain, the most thorough
psychologist of Bentham's school, refuses to admit
this line of defence for psychological hedonism,
and holds that, in actions such as those referred to,
men are really carried out of the circle of their
self-regarding desires.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But my present purpose is
not to discuss the merits of any such psychological
theory, but rather to investigate its ethical consequences.
And for this purpose the question requires
to be put, how a passage is effected from
psychological hedonism to an egoistic&mdash;and even
to a utilitarian&mdash;theory of ethics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The postulate
that
action can
be rationalised</div>

<p>If a man always acts for his greatest present
pleasure, real and imaginary, it seems a far step to
say that he "ought" to act&mdash;or in any way to
expect that he will act&mdash;at each moment for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>greatest sum of pleasure attainable in the probable
duration of his life. But on reflection, this may
turn out to follow if we postulate that conduct
can be rationalised. What is meant by this egoistic
"ought" may be said to be simply that to
the eye of reason the pleasure of any one moment
cannot be regarded as more valuable than the
equal pleasure of any other moment, if it is equally
certain; <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>involves
these conditions,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
and that therefore to act as if it were is to
act unreasonably. Man fails in acting up to reason
in this sense, because his action is not motived
by reason, but directly by pleasure and pain; and
not by a mere estimate of pleasure and pain, but
by pleasure and pain themselves. The psychological
hedonist must maintain that the estimates
of future pleasure and pain only become motives
by being not merely recognised (intellectually) but
felt (emotionally)&mdash;that is, by themselves becoming
pleasurable or painful. If the Egoist calls any
action irrational, it cannot be because the motive
which produced it was not the greatest pleasure
in consciousness at the time. It can only be on
the ground that the greatest pleasure in consciousness
at the time is likely to lead to a sacrifice of
greater pleasure in the future; and this must be
due either to intellectual misapprehension or to
the imagined fruition of future pleasure not being
strong enough to outweigh the pleasure which
comes from a present stimulus, and to the imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
fruition of the more distant being weaker than that
of the less distant pleasure. It is owing to a
defect of the imagination on a man's part that
even with complete information he does not act
"up to his lights"&mdash;irrational action being partly
a consequence of insufficient acquaintance with the
normal results of conduct, partly due to defective
imagination. Were a man's imagination of future
pleasure and pain as strong as his experience of
present pleasure and pain, and did he correctly
appreciate the results of his conduct, then his
action would, of psychological necessity, harmonise
with the precepts of egoistic hedonism.</p>

<p>Egoistic hedonism may therefore, in a certain
sense, be said to be a "reasonable" end of conduct
on the theory of psychological hedonism; it is the
end which will be made his own by that ideally
perfect man whose intellect can clearly see the
issues of conduct, and whose imagination of the
future causes of sensibility is so vivid that the
pleasure or pain got from anticipating them is as
great as if they were present, or only less lively in
proportion as there is a risk of their not being
realised. Conversely it would seem that only that
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>the latter of
which<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
man can act "reasonably" in whom imagination of
pleasure (or of pain) is already of equal strength
with the actual experience of it. But, if the "pleasures
of the imagination" are as strong as those of
sense or of reality, the latter obviously become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
superfluous; and it follows that the ideally perfect
man is left without any motive to aim at the real
thing, since he can obtain as much pleasure by
imagining it. The cultured hedonist must, it would
seem, be able to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>is inconsistent
with the nature of voluntary

So far as feeling or motive to action goes, no difference
must exist for him between reality and imagination.
And thus, although we may admit that,
on this psychological basis, conduct when rationalised
agrees with that prescribed by egoistic
hedonism, yet it can only be rationalised by a
development of the strength of the imagination,
which would make the feeling which it brings with
it as strong as that which accompanies a real object,
and hence take away the motive for the pursuit of
the latter. The discrepancy between representation
and presentation which is necessary for the
state of desire,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is no longer present. Hedonism
vindicates its rationality only on conditions which
imply the futility of action altogether. It is not
merely that the attainment of the hedonistic end in
practical conduct implies a strength of imagination
of which no one is capable, but the conditions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>acting both rationally and hedonistically, are conditions
which would paralyse all activity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Possible
objections
to preceding
argument:</div>

<p>The foregoing argument may perhaps be objected
to on two grounds. On the one hand, it may
be said that it ignores the vast complexity of human
motive, and treats action as if it were a simple
and abstract thing. On the other hand, we may be
reminded of the fact that, while all men act for
pleasure, the moral quality of their conduct does
not depend on this fact, but on the <em>kind</em> of things
in which they take pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) complexity
of motive;
but it
is psychological
hedonism
which ignores
this.</div>

<p>So far as the first objection is concerned, it seems
to me that the fault belongs to the psychological
theory of human action, the ethical consequences of
which are under investigation. It is this theory
which asserts that, however interwoven the threads
of impulse, aversion, and habit may be, their most
complex relations can be reduced to the formula,
"greatest pleasure, or least pain, prevails." It is
not necessary, indeed, that every action should be
the conscious pursuit of a pleasurable object already
before the mind in idea. But the theory, if consistently
carried out, implies that the action which
follows in the line of a previously formed habit,
does so because the discomfort or pain of breaking
through the habit would be sufficient to counter-balance
any satisfaction that might result. The objection,
therefore, of excessive simplicity or "abstractness,"
is one which cannot have greater force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
than when urged against the theory of psychological
hedonism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) difference
in kind
of pleasurable
objects;</div>

<p>Further&mdash;and this is the second objection&mdash;the
above analysis may be considered by some not to
have taken sufficient account of the difference in
the objects in which a human being can take pleasure,
and of the fact that the moral quality of men
differs, not according as they act for pleasure or
not, but according to the kind of actions and sufferances
in which they find pleasure. There can be
no doubt of the importance of this distinction for
questions of practical morals. The man in whom
"selfishness takes the shape of benevolence," as it
did in Bentham, is infinitely better than the man
in whom it retains the form of selfishness. But
the consideration is important just because it goes
on the implied assumption that the hedonistic is
not the chief aspect of conduct, and that there is a
difference between courses of action more fundamental
than the pleasurable or painful feeling attendant
on them. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>but this involves
a reference to something else than
pleasure,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
If the principles on which the objection
is founded were consistently adhered to and
followed out, they would make not pleasure, but
something else&mdash;that, namely, by which pleasures
differ from one another in kind&mdash;the ethical standard.
But if, in ultimate analysis, it is the pleasure
felt or expected that moves to action, it would seem
that there is no way in which the conclusion of the
preceding argument can be avoided. If pleasure is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the motive, it must be <i>quâ</i> pleasure&mdash;that is to say,
either the greatest apparent pleasure, or the greatest
present pleasure, is the motive. If difference of
quality be admitted, we are introducing a determining
factor other than pleasure. Certain kinds of
pleasure may be better than others for the race or
for the state. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>which psychological
hedonism does not admit of.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But these differences must be reducible
to terms of individual pleasure admitting of purely
quantitative comparisons, before they become motives
to action.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> From the point of view of the
whole, we may say that one action leads to a greater
sum of pleasure than another. But, in judging the
action of individuals, all that we can say of it is,
that to one man one class of actions gives pleasure,
to another another: each man is equally following
the course of action which either (<i>a</i>) will bring, or
(<i>b</i>) seems to him likely to bring, the greatest pleasure,
or (<i>c</i>) is actually most pleasant at the time.
From the nature of the individual we can evolve no
end beyond egoistic hedonism. And even this end
can only be made his at each occurrence of action
(assuming the first alternative (<i>a</i>) to be incorrect)
by enlightening his intellect so that (<i>b</i>) will correspond
with the actual greatest pleasure, or by also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>enlivening his imagination of future pleasures and
pains so that (<i>c</i>) will correspond with it; and this,
as has been shown, could only be effected under
conditions which are inconsistent with the principles
of human action.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE TRANSITION TO UTILITARIANISM.</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">1. Different
standpoints
of individual
and state</div>

<p>It still remains possible, of course, to fix an ethical
end in some other way than by studying individual
human nature. We may, for instance, looking from
the point of view of the community, fix its greatest
happiness, instead of his own, as the individual's
end. But the difficulty then arises of persuading
the individual&mdash;or, indeed, making it possible for
him&mdash;to regard this impersonal goal as the end of
his conduct. For this purpose, Bentham seemed to
look to the exercise of administrative control which,
by a system of rewards and punishments, will make
the greatest happiness of the individual coincide so
far as possible with that of the community.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> J. S.
Mill, on the other hand, with his eyes turned to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>subjective springs of action, saw in the gradual
growth of sympathetic pleasures and pains the
means by which an individual's desires would cease
to conflict with those of his neighbours.</p>

<p>It is in some such way that the transition is
made from Egoism to Utilitarianism. The transition
is made: Bentham and his school are an evidence
of the fact. But it is not therefore logical.
It is, indeed, important to notice that we only pass
from the one theory to the other by changing our
original individualistic point of view. Having already
fixed an end for conduct regardless of the
difference between the individual at the time of
acting and at subsequent times, we proceed to take
the much longer step of ignoring the difference between
the agent and other individuals. The question
is no longer, What is good or desirable for the
person who is acting? but, What is best on the
whole for all those whom his action may affect&mdash;that
is to say, for the community?</p>

<div class="sidenote">cannot be
logically
connected</div>

<p>But while it is comparatively easy to see how
this transition is effected as a matter of fact, it is
difficult to establish any logical connection between
its different stages, or to offer any considerations
fitted to convince the individual that it is reasonable
for him to seek the happiness of the community
rather than his own. Only that conduct, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
may seem, can be reasonable which directs and perfects
the natural striving of each organism towards
its own pleasure. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>through
analogy of
state to individual.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
We may, of course, let our point
of view shift from the individual to the social "organism."
And in this case, if the "natural" end
of each human being is his own greatest pleasure,
the end of the community, or organised body of
pleasure-seekers, will naturally be concluded to be
the greatest aggregate pleasure of its members.
Thus, if we can hypostatise the community, and
treat it as an individual with magnified but human
wants and satisfactions, then, for this leviathan, the
ethical end will correspond to what is called Utilitarianism
or Universalistic Hedonism. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Difference
between one's own pleasure and the pleasure
of others<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But, when
we remember that the community is made up of
units distinct from one another in feeling and action,
the difficulty arises of establishing it as the natural
end, or as a reasonable end, for each of these units
to strive after the greatest pleasure of all. For it
is evident that the pursuit of the greatest aggregate
pleasure may often interfere with the attainment
by the individual of his own greatest pleasure. On
the other hand, the self-seeking action of the individual
may no doubt lead to a loss of pleasure on
the whole; but then it is not his own pleasure that
is lost, only other people's. To the outsider&mdash;as
to the community&mdash;it may seem irrational that a
small increase in the pleasure of one unit should
be allowed at the expense of a loss of greater pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
on the part of other units. But it seems irrational
only because the outsider naturally puts himself
in the place of the community; and neither
takes account of the fact that to the individual agent
there is a fundamental difference between his own
pleasure and any one else's pleasure: for him the
former is, and the latter is not, pleasure at all.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">overlooked
in arguing
from egoism
to utilitarianism.</div>

<p>This fundamental difference seems to be overlooked
when the attempt is made to argue logically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>from egoistic psychology (or even from egoistic
ethics) to utilitarianism. Indeed, the hiatus in
logical proof is often only concealed by a confusion
of standpoints; and J. S. Mill, while emphasising
the distinction between modern Utilitarianism and
the older Epicureanism, has even allowed his
official "proof" of utilitarianism&mdash;such proof,
that is, as he thinks the principle of Utility to be
susceptible of&mdash;to rest on the ambiguity between
individual and social happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Connection
between
egoism and
utilitarianism
according
to Bentham:</div>

<p>This ambiguity does not seem to have been consistently
avoided even by Bentham. For the most
part, indeed, nothing can exceed the clearness with
which he recognises the twofold and possibly conflicting
interests involved in almost every action.
There is the interest of the agent, and the interest
of others whom his action may affect. And he
also holds that, in the case of divergence of interests,
the individual will act for his own. "The happiness
of the individuals," he says,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> "of whom a
community is composed,&mdash;that is, their pleasures,
and their security,&mdash;is the end, and the sole end,
which the legislator ought to have in view&mdash;the
sole standard in conformity to which each individual
ought, as far as depends upon the legislator,
to be <em>made</em> to fashion his conduct. But whether
it be this or anything else that is to be <em>done</em>, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>is nothing by which a man can ultimately be <em>made</em>
to do it, but either pain or pleasure"&mdash;that is, of
course, his own pain or pleasure. Here, then,
ethical Utilitarianism and psychological Egoism
are both plainly involved. A man, it is said, can
only pursue general happiness by its being identical
with his own happiness. And as it is evident, and
admitted, that these two happinesses often diverge
in the courses of action naturally leading to them,
a man can only be beneficent, rather than selfish,
through some artificial arrangement which makes
beneficence to be for his interest:<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> in plain language
(since rewards are only of exceptional applicability),
through his being punished for not
being beneficent.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>a</i>) Utilitarianism
not a political duty,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But, as Bentham clearly shows,
many cases of action cannot be safely touched by
the legislator's art. Such cases "unmeet for
punishment" include not only the actions which
are beneficial or neutral in their results, but also
actions hurtful to the community, though they
may elude such vigilance as the state can contrive,
or their restraint by punishment inflicted by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>state may constitute a greater evil than the
offence.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> <i>Probity</i> may be exacted by the "persons
stated and <i>certain</i>" who happen to be political
superiors: except in rare instances, positive <i>beneficence</i>
can not. Utilitarian conduct, therefore, is
not a "political duty," because it is not fully
enforced by definite punishment. The "art of
legislation" is indeed said to teach "how a multitude
of men, composing a community, may be
disposed to pursue that course which upon the
whole is the most conducive to the happiness of
the whole community, by means of motives to be
applied by the legislator."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But the means here
indicated are such as cannot fully compass the
attainment of the end. For the motives applied
by the legislator either cannot reach a large part
of the extra-regarding conduct of individuals, or
could only reach it by entailing greater evils than
those they would be used to prevent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) nor a
moral duty,</div>

<p>But if utilitarian conduct is not a political duty,
it may seem evident that it is at least a moral
duty. Now a moral duty is said by Bentham<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>be "created by a kind of motive which, from the
<em>un</em>certainty of the <i>persons</i> to apply it, and of the
<i>species</i> and <i>degree</i> in which it will be applied, has
hardly yet got the name of punishment: by various
mortifications resulting from the ill-will of persons
<em>un</em>certain and variable,&mdash;the community in general;
that is, such individuals of that community as he
whose duty is in question shall happen to be connected
with." In plain language, then, moral duty
simply means the ill-will of a man's neighbours
which follows his conduct in so far as that conduct
affects them disagreeably. Such ill-will on the
part of a man's neighbours may result from success
or from failure on his part, from a breach of etiquette,
from refusal to sacrifice to the caprice of
those neighbours the wider good of the society
whom his conduct affects (but to whom it may be
unknown), from deception or from telling the truth.
In a word, the duty&mdash;that is, the punishment&mdash;is
entirely uncertain: not only as regards the persons
applying it, its nature and its amount, but also as
regards the kind of actions to which it applies.
They will be actions unpleasant to the people who
inflict the punishment, but not necessarily hurtful
to the common weal: since the immediate effects
of an action are easily recognised, while its wider
and more lasting consequences are neither so apparent
nor appeal so surely to the interest of those
who are cognisant of the action and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
affected by it. Moral duty, therefore, as Bentham
defines it, depending on, or rather identical with,
the ill-will of one's neighbours, is indefinite and
limited in its nature, and can command or sanction
no such definite and wide-reaching rule for conduct
as that a man should always act for the greatest
happiness of the greatest number of people whom
his action may affect. Utilitarian conduct, therefore,
is neither a political duty nor a moral duty;
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>c</i>) nor insisted
on as a religious duty,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
nor does Bentham follow Paley in insisting upon
it as a religious duty "created by punishment; by
punishment expected at the hands of a person
<em>certain</em>&mdash;the Supreme Being." And "if he persists
in asserting it to be a duty&mdash;but without meaning
it to be understood that it is on any one of these
three accounts that he looks upon it as such&mdash;all
he then asserts is his own internal <i>sentiment</i>; all
he means then is that he feels himself <i>pleased</i> or
<i>displeased</i> at the thoughts of the point of conduct
in question, but without being able to tell <em>why</em>. In
this case he should e'en say so; and not seek to
give an undue influence to his own single suffrage,
by delivering it in terms that purport to declare
the voice either of God, or of the law, or of the
people."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>This plain piece of advice which Bentham gives
to Blackstone is not often neglected by himself.
The motive, he once said, of his own exceptional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
devotion to the interests of the community was
that it pleased him. "I am a selfish man," he wrote,
"as selfish as any man can be. But in me, somehow
or other, so it happens, selfishness has taken the
shape of benevolence."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But when the matter is
thus brought back from the regions of political,
moral, and religious duty, <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>d</i>) nor sufficiently
motived in private ethics,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
to the individual ground
of "private ethics," we have still to refer to Bentham's
own discussion of the question, "What motives
(independent of such as legislation and religion
may chance to furnish) can one man have to
consult the happiness of another?"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Bentham at
once replies&mdash;and indeed the answer on his principles
is obvious enough&mdash;that there is no motive
which always continues <i>adequate</i>. But yet there
are, he says, "no occasions in which a man has not
some motives for consulting the happiness of other
men." Such are "the purely-social motive of sympathy
or benevolence," and "the semi-social motives
of love of amity and love of reputation." A man
is directly moved to promote the happiness of
others through the sympathetic feelings which
make the happiness of others in some degree pleasurable
to himself; and he is indirectly moved to
promote their happiness through his desire of their
friendship and good opinion. So far, therefore, it
is quite true that "private ethics"&mdash;or what Bentham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>regards as such&mdash;"concerns every member&mdash;that
is, the happiness and the actions of every
member of any community that can be proposed."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
It certainly concerns their happiness, but only in
so far as this is a means to the happiness of the
agent. So that when Bentham says that "there
is no case in which a private man ought not to
direct his own conduct to the production of his
own happiness and of that of his fellow-creatures,"
he should rather say that a man will<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> only direct
his conduct to the happiness of his fellow-creatures
in so far as such action leads to his own happiness.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>which can be reduced to prudence.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Private ethics, therefore, has to do with the happiness
of others only so far as this reacts on the
happiness of self; or, as Bentham ultimately defines
it, in terms to which no exception can be taken:
"Private ethics teaches how each man may dispose
himself to pursue the course most conducive to his
own happiness by means of such motives as offer
of themselves."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">3. Bentham's
treatment exhaustive
from his point of view.</div>

<p>Under Bentham's hands "private ethics" is thus
reduced to prudence, at the same time that the
author has failed to show why the general happiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>is to be aimed at by the individual as a religious
or political or moral duty. Nor is this failure
due to any lack of skill in following out the consequences
which his premisses involved. The arguments
used against him have thus an equally valid
application to all who adopt the same general line
of thought. For Bentham appears to have seen as
clearly as any of his disciples the difficulty of bringing
the egoistic basis of his theory of human nature
into harmony with the universal reference required
by his ethics. And the criticism already offered of
the way in which Bentham attempts to bring about
this connection may be shown not to be restricted
to his special way of putting the case.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remember that throughout this
chapter we are looking from the individual's point
of view, and inquiring how far it is possible to work
from it in the direction of utilitarianism. Now it
is admitted that, in pursuing his own happiness,
he is sometimes led, and may be led on the whole,
to neglect the general happiness. A sufficient
reason for following the latter&mdash;or an obligation to
do it&mdash;can therefore only come either from the
supreme power or from one's fellow-men, and from
the latter either as organised in the State, and expressing
themselves by its constituted authorities,
or else by the vaguer method of social praise and
blame. Bentham's classification of the possible
sources or kinds of duty into religious, political,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and moral [or social], is therefore a natural consequence
of the individualistic system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) The religious
sanction,</div>

<p>The first of these possible sources of duty is indeed
only mentioned by Bentham, and then passed
by. And yet it might seem that the religious sanction
is a more efficient motive-power than the
social, while it applies to regions of conduct which
legal enactment cannot reach. Without question,
the operation of such a motive is capable of bringing
egoistic conduct into harmony with utilitarianism,
or with any other principle of action to which the
sanction may be attached. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>relied on by
Paley,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
"Private happiness is our motive, and the will of God our rule," says
Paley;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and in this case such conduct will be
obligatory as the rule may arbitrarily determine;
while, whatever it may be, there will be a strong
enough motive to follow it. The whole fabric of a
moral philosophy such as Paley's, therefore, rests
on two theological propositions&mdash;that God has ordained
the general happiness as the rule of human
conduct, and that He will punish in another life
those who disregard that rule. The basis of morality
is laid in a divine command enforced by a
divine threat. Perhaps it will be generally agreed
that Bentham acted wisely in not laying stress on
this application of the "religious sanction." Even
those least inclined to theological agnosticism would
reject any such rough-and-ready <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>inverts the
relation between ethics and theology.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
solution of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>problem which deals with the relation of morality
to the divine nature. Paley's method of treatment,
they would say, inverts the relation in which theism
stands to morality. The divine will cannot be
thus arbitrarily connected with the moral law. It
can be conceived to approve and sanction such an
object as the happiness of mankind only when God
is first of all regarded as a moral being, and the happiness
of mankind as an object of moral action. If any
relation of consequence can be asserted between them,
the general happiness is to be regarded as a moral
duty first, and only afterwards as a religious duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) Limits of
the political
sanction.</div>

<p>When he comes to the political sanction, Bentham's
treatment wants nothing in respect of fulness,
and even those who do not agree with his estimate
of the infelicific character of many existing
institutions and enactments will admit that even the
best-intentioned legislator cannot make utilitarian
conduct a political duty. We must bear in mind
here, also, the effect which individual desires and
opinions have not only on social judgments, but also
on statute-law. In arguing on the relation of the
individual to the State, we are too ready to forget
that the State is represented by a legislator or body
of legislators, and that we can never assume that
in their cases private interest has already become
identified with the larger interests of the community.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
For were this the case, the accusation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>of class-legislation or private interest would not be
heard so often as it is.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) Uncertainty
of the
social sanction,</div>

<p>A modern disciple of Bentham would thus be
compelled, just as Bentham himself was, to make
utilitarianism neither a political nor religious but
a "moral" duty, enforced by and founded on the
shifting and uncertain punishments or sanctions of
society&mdash;what Professor Bain describes as "the
unofficial expressions of disapprobation and the
exclusion from social good offices."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But as a
logical proof of utilitarianism, this means is, if
possible, weaker than the preceding; for social
opinion, though of somewhat wider applicability
than legal enactment, has probably been, for the
most part, in even less exact correspondence than
it with the general happiness. The social sanction
is strict on indifferent points of etiquette, does not
consult the general interests of mankind on points
of honour, and is lenient towards acts that the
utilitarian moralist condemns.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">(<i>d</i>) and of
the internal
sanction so
far as a result
of the
social.</div>

<p>Professor Bain, however, advances from the external
disapprobation to an internal sanction&mdash;looking
upon conscience as one of the powers which
inflicts punishment, and lies at the source of the
feeling of obligation. But if conscience is only "an
ideal resemblance of public authority, growing up
in the same individual mind, and working to the
same end," it can, as little as its archetype, point
to the maxim of utilitarianism. According to
Professor Bain, it is through this sentiment&mdash;at
first a mere imitation of external authority&mdash;that
the individual becomes a law to himself, on recognising
the utilities that led to the imposition of the
law.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> But on this theory, in so far as conscience
continues to point to the conduct impressed upon
it by its external pattern, it fails to correspond
with the utilitarian maxim. If, on the other hand,
it is modified by the comprehensive and unselfish
view of the effects of conduct which utilitarianism
demands, it must be at the expense of correcting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>its original edicts, and so far discrediting its authoritative
claims.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of the
social sanction</div>

<p>The "social sanction" would be of much greater
service if used to show how a solidarity is brought
about between the interests and feelings of the
individual and those of his neighbours, from which
the utilitarian maxim may be arrived at by a generalisation
of his principle of conduct as modified
by the social impulse. But this would not constitute
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>apart from
logical proof
of utilitarianism.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
a logical justification of utilitarianism: it would
show how the principle has been arrived at, but
without giving a sufficient reason to the individual
for adopting it. And this is really the tendency of
much recent discussion&mdash;of Professor Bain's theory
of conscience as a reflex of the external order, of
George Grote's analysis of the moral sentiment,
and of Mill's doctrine of the progressive identification
of the individual's feelings with those of his
neighbours through the gradual increase of sympathetic
pleasures and pains: for it was to this
source that Mill looked for the practical solution
of the antinomy between his psychological and
ethical theories, though he himself tried to pass
from one position to the other by means of
the "highway in the air" constructed by his own
logic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">4. Mill's
logical defence
of
utilitarianism:</div>

<p>Mill's attempt to pass by a logical method from
psychological hedonism to utilitarianism is an instructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
commentary on the difficulties which
beset the transition. His work may be described
as a vindication of the utilitarian morality, first,
from the charge of sensualism; and secondly, from
that of selfishness. And it is largely owing to his
polemic that utilitarianism is no longer looked
upon as either a sensual or a selfish theory. It
is not sensual, unless, indeed, the pleasures of most
men are of a sensual kind. So far from being
selfish, it is almost stoical in the subordination of
individual desires it enjoins. But Mill wished to
do more than clear the character of utilitarian
ethics. He wished to show a logical reason for
utilitarians pursuing elevated pleasures rather than
base ones, and to demonstrate the connection of his
moral imperative with the principles which the
school he belonged to laid down for human motives.
In both these respects his failure is conspicuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) distinction
of kinds of pleasure,</div>

<p>In the former endeavour, he went against Bentham
by attempting to draw a distinction in kind
amongst pleasures&mdash;a distinction not reducible to
quantitative measurement. A higher degree of
quality in the pleasure sought was to outweigh any
difference in its amount or quantity. With this
modification, utilitarianism is made to require a
subordination of the lower or sensuous nature to
the higher or intellectual nature. Pleasure, indeed,
is still the end; but the "higher" pleasure takes
precedence over the "lower," irrespective of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
amount of pleasant feeling that results. Pleasure
is still the standard, but not the ultimate standard;
for a further appeal has to be made to the criterion
that distinguishes one pleasure from another, not
as merely greater or less, but as higher or lower.
As is well known, Mill did not look either to the
action or to the feeling itself for this criterion. To
have done so would have implied an acknowledgment
that pleasure was no longer regarded as the
ultimate standard. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>determined
by authority,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
He found the criterion of
superiority simply in the opinion people of experience
have about the relative desirability of
various sorts of pleasure. But such a criterion
only pushes the final question of the standard one
step farther back. Those people of experience to
whom Mill refers&mdash;who have tried both kinds of
pleasure, and prefer one of them<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>&mdash;can they give
no reason for, no account of, their preference? If
so, to trust them is to appeal to blind authority,
and to relinquish anything like a science of ethics.
But, if Mill's authorities can reflect on their feelings,
as well as feel, they can only tell us one or other
of two things. Either the so-called "higher" pleasure
is actually, as pleasure, so preferable to that
called "lower," that the smallest amount of the one
would be more pleasurable than the largest amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>of the other; or else the higher is called higher,
and is to be preferred to the lower&mdash;even although
the latter may be greater as pleasure&mdash;because of a
quality belonging to it over and above its character
as pleasant feeling. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>either can
be reduced to difference of quantity, or leads to
non-hedonistic standard;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The former verdict would be
in the first place paradoxical, and, in the second
place, would give up Mill's case, by reducing
quality to a quantitative standard. Besides, it
would be no valid ground of preference for men in
general; since the pleasure of various actions and
states differs according to the susceptibility of the
subject. According to the latter verdict, the characteristic
upon which the distinction of quality
depends, and not pleasure itself, becomes the
ethical standard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) ambiguities
in his
proof of
utilitarianism.</div>

<p>In respect of his main contention, that utilitarianism
is a theory of beneficence, and not of prudence
or of selfishness, Mill emphasised even more strongly
than Bentham has done the distinction between
the egoism which seeks its own things, and the
utilitarianism according to which everybody counts
for one, and nobody for more than one. But when
he attempted to connect this doctrine logically with
the psychological postulates of his school, he committed
a double error. In the first place, he confused
the purely psychological question of the motives
that influence human conduct with the ethical
question of the end to which conduct ought to be
directed; and, in the second place, he disregarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the difference of end there may be for society as a
collective whole, and for each member of the society
individually. "There is in reality," he says,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> "nothing
desired except happiness;" and this psychological
theory is too hastily identified with the ethical
principle that happiness alone is desirable, or what
ought to be desired and pursued. Moreover, "no
reason," he says, "can be given why the general
happiness is desirable, except that each person, so
far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his
own happiness." And this admission, which seems
as good as saying that no reason at all can be given
why the individual should desire the general happiness,
is only held to be a sufficient reason for it,
through assuming that what is good for all as an
aggregate is good for each member of the aggregate:
"That each person's happiness is a good to that
person, and the general happiness, therefore, a good
to the aggregate of all persons."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Imperfect
coherence
of ethical
and theoretical
philosophy.</div>

<p>It may appear strange to offer the preceding as the
logical basis of an ethical principle which has had
so wide and, on the whole, beneficial an influence
as utilitarianism. The explanation is to be found
in the want of full coherence which often exists,
and is nowhere commoner than in English ethics,
between an author's practical view of life and the
foundation of psychology or metaphysics with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>it is connected. It would certainly be wrong to
imagine that Bentham's self-denying labours rested
on a confusion of standpoints, or that Mill's moral
enthusiasm had no other support than a logical
quibble. To both of them, and to many others,
utilitarianism was an ethical creed influencing their
lives, which was scarcely connected with the attempt
to justify it logically. Such reasons in its
favour as they adduced were rather after-thoughts
for the defence of their creed than the foundations
on which it was built.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Actual
transition to
utilitarianism.</div>

<p>The formula of utilitarianism cannot be expressed
as the conclusion of a syllogism or of an inductive
inference. It seems rather to have been arrived at
by the production&mdash;or the recognition&mdash;of a sympathetic
or "altruistic" sentiment, which was made
to yield a general principle for the guidance of conduct
This process involves two steps, which are
consecutive and complementary, although the positions
they connect are not necessarily related. The
first step is to overcome the selfish principle of
action in the individual; the second to generalise
it and obtain a principle for the non-selfish action
that results. Mill seems to be the only recent
writer who, in making this transition, adheres
strictly to the psychological hedonism distinctive
of his school. He looks to the influence of education
in increasing the feeling of unity between one
man and his neighbours, till individual action becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
merged in altruistic or social action. "The
social state," he says, "is at once so natural, so
necessary, and so habitual to man, that, except in
some unusual circumstances, or by an effort of
voluntary abstraction, he never conceives himself
otherwise than as a member of a body."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This is
perfectly true, but does not imply a sublation of
selfishness. A man "never conceives himself otherwise
than as a member of a body;" but it does not
follow from this that he will subordinate his own
interests to the interests of the other members when
the two clash. In cases of conflict the individual
often tends to sacrifice the good of his neighbours
to his own good; and he may do so although he
fully recognises the social consequences of action,
just because he still remains at the ethical standpoint
which treats private good as superior to public.
It is true, as Mill contends, that, "in an improving
state of the human mind, the influences are constantly
on the increase, which tend to generate in each
individual a feeling of unity with all the rest; which
feeling, if perfect, would make him never think of,
or desire, any beneficial condition for himself, in
the benefits of which they are not included."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But
this is not sufficient to connect the two antagonistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>poles of Mill's system. It starts with assuming the
notion of an "improving state" of the human mind, as
determined according to an ethical standard not yet
arrived at; and it gives no valid account of the means
by which the improvement is to be brought about.
It is prophetic of a time when the motives of human
nature will have been so modified that the antagonism
between self and others will be no longer felt;
but it offers no practical solution of the antinomy
suited to present circumstances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) recognition
of Sympathy</div>

<p>The basis of the ethical sentiment by which the
desires and actions of a man are to be brought into
harmony with those of his fellows is investigated
in a more thorough manner by Professor Bain and
by George Grote. But both of these writers stand
on a somewhat different platform from the strict
psychological hedonism which Mill never relinquished.
Thus Grote enumerates as "elementary
tendencies of the mind," which ethical sentiment
presupposes, and out of which it is compounded,
self-regarding tendencies, sympathetic tendencies,
benevolent affections, malevolent affections, and
(though in a smaller degree) love and hatred of
those who cause pleasure and pain to others;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and
this without interpreting sympathy, in the way that
Mill does, as having for its end the pleasures which
come with the gratification of the sympathetic
impulse, or the removal of the pain caused by its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>restraint. As Professor Bain argues, this position
of Mill's "is tenable only on the ground that the
<i>omission</i> of a disinterested act that we are inclined
to, would give us so much <i>pain</i> that it is on the
whole for our comfort that we should make the
requisite sacrifice. There is plausibility in this
supposition." But "the doctrine breaks down
when we try it upon extreme cases.... All
that people usually suffer from stifling a generous
impulse is too slight and transient to be placed
against any important sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>as disinterested,
by Bain,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In recognising
sympathy as a "purely disinterested" impulse,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Mr
Bain breaks loose at an important point from the
psychology of Bentham. He is indeed only kept
from a complete break with it by the position he
ascribes to sympathy as outside of the ordinary
sphere of voluntary action. Above all things, it
would seem to be necessary that nothing should
conflict with "our character as rational beings,
which is to desire everything exactly according
to its pleasure-value."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> But sympathy obviously
"clashes with the regular outgoings of the will
in favour of our pleasures;" so that it ought to
be placed outside voluntary action, and regarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>simply as "a remarkable and crowning instance
of the Fixed Idea."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">without being
applied
to determine
the ethical
end,</div>

<p>It is owing to its exclusion, as a fixed idea, from
the sphere of voluntary conduct, that sympathetic
appropriation of the feelings of others has little or
no place assigned it by Professor Bain, when he goes
on<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> to describe the way in which the moral opinions
of men have actually originated. They have, he
holds, a twofold source&mdash;the one arising from the
necessity for public security, the other being of
sentimental origin. The former makes society
ordain those acts and services required for its own
preservation. The latter leads to the confusion of
this necessary element of morality with the sentimental
likes and dislikes which may be characteristic
of different people. These are "mixed up in
one code with the imperative duties that hold
society together;" and it is only when "we disentangle
this complication, and refer each class of
duties to their proper origin," that we can "obtain
a clear insight into the foundations of morality."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Morality, therefore, is that which is imposed by
society for its own preservation and security, and
which is sanctioned by the punishments of society
either in its "public judicial acts," or "by the
unofficial expressions of disapprobation and the
exclusion from social good offices."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Of this external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>law the moral sense or conscience is merely
a subjective mirror or copy. The duty of unselfishness
is not connected with the disinterested impulse
of sympathy, but is traced to the external order of
society, which has found it necessary to restrain
the self-seeking action of individuals&mdash;a restraint
which has come to be transferred to the consciences
of the members of the society.</p>

<p>Mr Bain's theory falls back in this way upon
external authority, just as Bentham's did; and, for
the same reasons, they are neither of them able to
prescribe the utilitarian principle of conduct. But,
in his assertion of the disinterested nature of sympathy,
Mr Bain has introduced&mdash;though he has not
himself utilised&mdash;a fruitful principle, by means of
which a basis of moral sentiment may be found
by means of which it is possible to escape from
ethical as well as psychological egoism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and by
Grote.</div>

<p>This element of sympathy is most fully recognised
in the instructive analysis of ethical sentiment
by the late George Grote. At the same time, Grote
does not, like Adam Smith, for instance, attempt to
evolve the material characteristics of approbation
and disapprobation from this source. The mere
putting of one's self in the place of a spectator&mdash;or
in that of the patient&mdash;instead of that of the agent,
is only a formal change, which will modify our
judgments or feelings without accounting for their
actual content. But a uniform formal element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in all ethical sentiment is, according to Grote, a
man's "constant habit of viewing and judging of
circumstances around him," both from the point of
view of the agent and from that of the patient.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
This twofold position is occupied by every individual.
He is an agent, and in that position his own
interests and feelings are separate from, and often
at variance with, those of others. But he is also a
patient in respect of the actions of others, and in
that position his interests and his feelings are commonly
in unison with those of the majority. Hence
a man is led constantly to adopt ideally the point
of view which is not actually his own at the time,
so that "the idea of the judgment which others will
form becomes constantly and indissolubly associated
with the idea of action in the mind of every
agent." In every community, certain actions are
visited with the admiration, esteem, and protection
of the society; certain other actions with the opposite
feelings and results: so that there arises "an
association in my mind of a certain line of conduct
on the part both of myself and of any other individual
agent, with a certain sentiment resulting from
such conduct, and excited by it, in the minds of the
general public around us. It is a sentiment of
<i>regulated social reciprocity</i> as between the agent
and the society amongst which he lives." And
this sentiment, when enforced by a sanction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>constitutes the complete form of ethical sentiment.</p>

<p>As a complete explanation of the moral sentiments
and judgments of men, this theory does not
seem to be above criticism. It requires not only
an association between every personal action and
the feelings&mdash;sympathetically imagined by the
agent&mdash;with which the action will be regarded by
others, but it also implies that this association has
become so inseparable that the feeling appears as
an individual or personal one, distinguished by the
subject from other sentiments which he has on consciously
imagining himself in the position of others.
But it is referred to here as illustrating what we
find in Mill, and, in a different way, in Professor
Bain, that the first real step towards the utilitarian
standard is to make the individual pass somehow
or other to a standpoint outside his own nature.
In Mill this is done mainly by the assertion of the
social nature of man, in Grote by showing how a
moral sentiment may be arrived at by the combined
action of sympathy and association.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) The idea
of Equality</div>

<p>The further influence required in the transition
to utilitarianism is the idea of equality. The best
expression of utilitarian doctrine followed soon after
the assertion of the equal rights of men which
signalised the politics of the end of last century
in the French and American revolutions. Bentham
was permeated by the spirit of this movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
however far he might be from accepting its abstractions
about natural rights. In his hands, too,
utilitarianism was a political rather than an ethical
doctrine. "Everybody to count for one and nobody
for more than one" follows naturally from the
phrase, "the greatest happiness of the greatest
number." <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>necessary to
regulate
sympathy;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Without this assertion of the necessity
of an equal distribution, there is no safeguard
against sympathy being restricted and partial in
its operation. Indeed the feeling of sympathy in
itself is naturally strongest towards those with
whom one is in most frequent relation, or connected
by numerous associative ties; and if left to
itself, it might therefore be expected to give rise to
the extended selfishness of class or family interest,
only relieved by a spasmodic humanitarianism.
This tendency is corrected by the dogma of human
equality, which had been formulated as a juridical
maxim in the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Gentium</i>, but afterwards
passed into a political creed, and found vent in the
literature of the eighteenth century and in the
public events which marked its close.</p>

<p>The change which this notion of human equality&mdash;passed
through has been traced by Sir Henry
Maine. "Where the Roman jurisconsult had
written 'æquales sunt,' meaning exactly what he
said, the modern civilian wrote 'all men are
equal' in the sense of 'all men ought to be equal.'
The peculiar Roman idea that natural law coexisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
with civil law and gradually absorbed it,
had evidently been lost sight of, or had become
unintelligible, and the words that had at most
conveyed a theory concerning the origin, composition,
and development of human institutions, were
beginning to express the sense of a great standing
wrong suffered by mankind."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>influence of
the idea on Bentham.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Now Bentham,
however far he may have been from trusting to
the system of 'natural law,'<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> was certainly not
beyond the influence of the idea of human equality
which it carried in its train; and, from his own
point of view, he laboured to defend it. In assimilating
this idea, utilitarianism has preserved one
of the best results of the old "law of nature,"
without the ambiguity with which it had formerly
been used,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> if in a sense which admits of a somewhat
narrow and abstract interpretation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true that this does not give exactly the
result which is usually described as utilitarianism.
I have spoken of the notion of equality as the
regulator of sympathy&mdash;a canon in accordance with
which the sympathetic impulse is to be guided.
Sympathy impels us to relieve the pains and increase
the pleasures of our fellow-men. The principle
of equality dictates that this sympathetic
activity is to be directed to the happiness of all
men equally. Every one whom our conduct may
be made to affect is to count as a unit, and a unit
only. The distribution is not to be according to
kinship of blood or social ties, though it is so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
more in our power to promote the happiness of
those closely connected with us, that it may fairly
occupy a larger share of our thought and energy
than the happiness of other people does. Utilitarianism
carries the application of the principle
of equality still farther, by looking upon self as a
unit whose happiness is to be regarded as of exactly
equal value with that of any one else. With every
individual reduced to the same ethical worth,
happiness is declared to be the end of moral action,
and equality of distribution the rule for deciding
between the claims of competing individuals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. The two
sides of
utilitarian
theory not
logically
connected.</div>

<p>It seems to me, therefore, that utilitarianism is
a theory compounded out of two quite different elements.
On the one side the basis of the theory has
been laid by Bentham and Mill in a naturalistic
psychology which looks upon pleasure as the only
object of desire. To this there is superadded the
idea of equality, which is the distinctively ethical
element in the theory. But it is only by confusion
that the idea of equality&mdash;which Bentham expresses
by the proposition that the happiness of one man
is to count for no more than the happiness of
another&mdash;can be supposed to be derived from the
same theory of human nature as that which identifies
pleasure and desire. Utilitarianism only
becomes a practicable end for individual conduct
when psychological hedonism has been given up.
It is futile to say that one ought to pursue the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
greatest happiness of the greatest number, unless
it is possible for the individual to act for something
else than his own pleasure&mdash;that is, for an
end which is for him not pleasure at all. In a
word, utilitarianism, while maintaining that the
only thing worth desiring is pleasure, must at the
same time admit that pleasure is not the only
object that can be or is desired: otherwise, it can
never advance from the egoistic to the universalistic
form.</p>

<p>This view receives confirmation from the way in
which utilitarianism is held by the most eminent
of living moralists. In the 'Methods of Ethics,'
the tradition of Bentham is expressly united with
the doctrines of Butler and Clarke. Professor
Sidgwick agrees with Bentham, and the long line
of moralists from Epicurus downwards, in maintaining
the doctrine of ethical hedonism, that
pleasure is the only thing ultimately desirable;
but, with Butler, he rejects the psychological
hedonism, according to which pleasure is the only
object of desire. So far from these two positions
being inconsistent, it is only through the second
that the first can be held in its universalistic form.
The problem is, however, how to unite them. In
Professor Sidgwick's theory, they are connected by
the application of the ethical maxims of benevolence
and equity, which an exhaustive examination
of ethical intuitions has left standing as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
axioms of the practical reason. Though utilitarianism,
therefore, is still adhered to, it is on an
expressly Rational ground, not on the basis of
Naturalism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">7. Summary
of ethical
consequences
of psychological
hedonism:</div>

<p>In this and the previous chapter, I have looked
at human nature from the point of view of psychological
hedonism, and have endeavoured to show
what ethical principles that theory leads to, or is
consistent with. The theory does not deny that
there is a great diversity of capacities and interests
in man. But it holds that, so far as concerns
conduct, they admit of being brought under one
general law&mdash;that every action is subject to the
rule of the "two sovereign masters, pleasure and
pain." It is evident, therefore, that if ethics is
to be connected at all with psychology&mdash;if what
ought to be done is in any degree what can be
done&mdash;the end of conduct must be hedonistic.
The psychological fact cannot indeed be without
more ado turned into a moral imperative. Yet
this much may be admitted, that if this interpretation
of action leaves room for ethics at all, the
end prescribed can be nothing else than pleasure,
or the avoidance of pain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) no logical
connection
with
utilitarianism;</div>

<p>The question, therefore, was how to determine
the pleasure which is to be sought? And I have
tried to show, in the chapter just concluded, that
utilitarianism does not admit of being logically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
arrived at from this point of view. It may indeed,
under certain circumstances,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> be the guide of political
or social enactments; but these can only be
made to bear upon the conduct of individuals
by the sanctions which the State or Society has
at its command. The individual can have as his
maxim of conduct an end which corresponds with
utilitarianism in two events only: when he is
so constituted as to find his pleasure in the greatest
aggregate pleasure of mankind, or when the
political and social sanctions are so complete and
searching as to make his individual interest and
the collective interest coincide. The former event
is unfortunately too rare to be taken into account
in establishing a theory; the latter would imply
an interference with individual liberty so impracticable
that it is not contemplated even in the most
comprehensive of socialistic schemes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) admits
of rational
egoism</div>

<p>Hedonism in psychology, therefore, means egoism
in ethics. But even this theory, as the previous
chapter has shown, has its own difficulties to meet.
The antagonism of individual and universal has not
yet been got rid of. The difficulty is no longer
caused by the conflict between one man and his
neighbours: it is the difference between the feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>and action of a moment, and the sum of feelings and
actions which makes up a lifetime. It is true that,
if we admit that pleasure is the only thing worth
pursuing, and that by "pleasure" a man means
"his own pleasure," there is so far no reason for
preferring the pleasure of one moment to that of
another, except as more certain or of greater
amount or degree;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> but this is to start with ascribing
a value to pleasure, and not with the simple
fact that pleasure is desired. If psychological
hedonism is our starting-point&mdash;and we give to the
theory the interpretation that has the greatest
verisimilitude&mdash;it is the greatest present pleasure
that rules. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>only under
impossible
conditions.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
And, although the man of reflection
will no doubt attempt to estimate the future pleasure
at its true value in comparison with the
pleasure actually present, this can never have full
effect upon his will. It has been shown, indeed,
that the realisation of egoistic hedonism is not
merely unattainable from the point of view of
psychological hedonism, but that it would involve
conditions inconsistent with the nature of desire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>MORAL SENTIMENT.</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">1. A uniform
theory
such as psychological
hedonism</div>

<p>Psychological hedonism possesses the merit of
offering a simple and uniform theory of mental
action. It may admit conflicting accounts of the
kinds of action and sufferance which actually give
men pleasure and pain,&mdash;a point on which, for
example, Hobbes and J. S. Mill differ widely.
But it has one general formula for the relation of
feeling to action, which has been precise and clear
enough to attract many psychologists. The ethical
consequences of the theory have, indeed, turned
out&mdash;if the argument of the preceding chapters
is valid&mdash;to be neither so obvious nor so satisfactory
as its adherents have commonly supposed.
But it must nevertheless be admitted that, if
psychology shows pleasure to be, as a matter of
fact, the constant end of action, it will be useless&mdash;even
if it is not impossible&mdash;for ethics to prescribe
any other end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">not supplied
by the opponents
of
ethical hedonism,</div>

<p>The opponents of ethical hedonism have thus
uniformly insisted that the theory which makes
pleasure the end and motive of all conscious activity
is imperfect; and this psychological question has
been the battle-field of many of the controversies,
at any rate, of English ethics. Psychological hedonism
has not, however, been confronted by the
English moralists with an opposed theory of equal
simplicity, nor can the controversy be said to
have led to a thorough analysis of action. The
psychological investigation has, in most cases, been
carried no farther than the ethical interests at
stake seemed to require; and the predominance
of these interests has perhaps prevented the inquiry
from being carried out with complete freedom
from preconception on either side.</p>

<p>A uniform theory under which our various particular
desires might be brought may, indeed, be
said to have been suggested by Butler. He meets
the hedonistic proposition that all desire is for
personal pleasure, by the doctrine that no particular
desire has pleasure as its end, since all pleasure
presupposes a previous desire in the satisfaction
of which it consists.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This theory, which may
have been derived from Plato,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and was afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>used by Schopenhauer to prove the negative nature
of pleasure and consequent worthlessness of life,
is, however, a generalisation which cannot be made
to include the whole facts to be taken account of.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Many pleasures occur independently of any precedent
desire. And what Butler had to show&mdash;and
was really concerned to show&mdash;was that desire
was not exclusively directed to objects thus independently
found to be pleasurable: the contradictory,
that is to say, and not the contrary, of
psychological hedonism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">in maintaining
the reality
of non-hedonistic
activity.</div>

<p>For this purpose Butler pointed to the whole
class of affections which, although they may also
tend to private interest, have an immediate reference
to the good of others; and, in addition to
these, he contended for an original principle of
benevolence towards others in human nature, as
well as of self-love or care for one's own interests
and happiness. This latter, he held, so far from
being the sole principle of action, implied the existence
of a number of particular passions and affections,
directed immediately to external objects&mdash;the
satisfaction of these desires giving pleasure, though
pleasure was not the end they aimed at. Voluntary
action is thus not brought under any common
rubric; for, at the same time that the calm principle
of self-love is directed to the agent's greatest
pleasure, the object of hunger, for example, is said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>to be not pleasure but food, that of benevolence
not personal pleasure but the good of others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Non-hedonistic
action
generalised
by Herbart,</div>

<p>The attempt to give unity to the non-hedonistic
view of desire has come from a different quarter.
Uninfluenced by the exigencies of ethical controversy,
which formed the entire motive of Butler's
investigation, Herbart and his school have worked
out a theory of desire, which has many points of
comparison with that of Butler. However much
they may differ from the English moralist&mdash;of
whose existence they are mostly ignorant&mdash;they
are at one with him in rejecting the maxim of
psychological hedonism, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nihil appetimus nisi sub
specie boni</i>; and their differences from him are
largely due to their having gone further in their
analysis of the facts, and endeavoured to bring them
under a general principle.</p>

<p>Butler's view of the object of desire is distinguished
from the Herbartian chiefly in two respects.
In the first place, he identifies that object with the
external or real thing, whereas Herbart is careful
to point out that it is a presentation or idea. In
the second place, while Butler is content to postulate
an original tendency of our nature towards
certain objects, Herbart attempts to get behind this
tendency, and explain the phenomena of striving
from the interaction of presentations. Over and
above the ordinary hypothesis of natural realism,
Butler's theory implies a sort of pre-established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
harmony between our active tendencies and things
outside the mind, in virtue of which some of these
things do, and some do not, attract our desires.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>from the
tendency of
ideas to self-realisation.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Herbart, on the other hand, attempts nothing less
than a complete genetic account of mental phenomena,
explaining the facts of presentation, desire,
and feeling through "the persistence of presentation
in consciousness and their rise into clearer
consciousness."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The phenomena of desire and
feeling are both accounted for by this mechanism
of impelling and inhibiting forces.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>It would be beyond the scope of this Essay to
examine the above view of the active side of mental
phenomena. For present purposes it is enough to
draw attention to the fact that the common deduction
of the phenomena of desire and will from
the feelings of pleasure and pain is not the only
"scientific" theory of human action, and that it
is rejected on its merits by writers who have no
hankering after what the psychological hedonist
would call the mystical element of free-will. It
is of interest to note, too, that Professor Bain, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>whose works the traditions of psychological hedonism
find their most careful expression, has modified
the doctrine so as to allow of desire of pleasure and
avoidance of pain explaining less than had been
formerly required of them. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>This tendency
recognised in the doctrine of
fixed ideas<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Outside the circle of
hedonistically-determined motives, he recognises the
influence of the presentation or idea as a self-realising
element in the individual consciousness, apart
from its pleasurable or painful characteristics.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Those "fixed ideas," as Mr Bain calls them,
tend both to persist in the mind, and to project
themselves into action, independently of pleasure
and pain&mdash;or at least with a force which is out of
proportion to the pleasure they bring. As has been
already seen, it is by means of this doctrine that he
explains "the great fact of our nature denominated
sympathy, fellow-feeling, pity, compassion, disinterestedness."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
To the same category belongs "much
of the ambition and the aspirations of human
beings.... A certain notion&mdash;say of power,
wealth, grandeur&mdash;has fixed itself in our mind and
keeps a persistent hold there." It is asserted, indeed,
that the action of such fixed ideas "perverts
the regular operation of the will which would lead
us to renounce whatever is hopeless or not worth
the cost." And, certainly, their admission among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>mental phenomena seems to imply the superposition
of a new theory of action upon the old theory of psychological
hedonism. There is no disguising the importance
of the modification thus introduced. The
name "fixed idea" is misleading if it be taken to
imply that persistency and tendency to action are
properties belonging to a certain class of ideas only.
Mr Bain's doctrine is founded on the hypothesis of
the identity of the nervous centres which function
in representation and in sensation, and is therefore
valid of all representations or ideas. The characteristics
of persistency, and of tendency to action,
are therefore normal characteristics of presentations,
though they may belong in an unusual degree to
some ideas from the relation these hold to the
dominant cluster of ideas in the individual consciousness.
And if we thus attribute to all ideas
without exception the tendency to self-realisation,
and recognise&mdash;as we must&mdash;the relation of mutual
assistance or inhibition which ideas bear to one
another in virtue of their being "presented" to the
same subject, we have granted the material out of
which, in Herbart's skilful "Mechanik des Geistes,"
the phenomena of feeling and desire are woven.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">2. The non-hedonistic
theory of
action.</div>

<p>The view of individual human nature, which
holds that all its desires are not directed to personal
pleasure, thus claims consideration. With
its less restricted theory of action, this doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
may seem to offer a larger means of determining
the appropriate end of human conduct. In particular,
the suggestion naturally occurs that the
ethical end will, on this theory, be something else
than pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But there is, nevertheless, no contradiction
in holding&mdash;as Mr Sidgwick does&mdash;that
although other objects than pleasure are actually
desired, there is nothing else which can be held to
be ultimately desirable, or the tendency to which
can be said to have moral worth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty of
unifying the
various impulses
it
implies,</div>

<p>The ethical barrenness of psychological hedonism
has been seen to result from its narrow and inflexible
view of human nature. But theories such as
those now to be considered have, in an ethical
regard, to overcome a difficulty of another kind in
the variety of impulses which they admit upon the
stage. The "objects" to which these impulses or
desires relate have as yet received no further characterisation
than that they are objects of desire. And
the difficulty of finding a principle by which some
order of precedence or value amongst them may be
determined is just, in other words, the difficulty of
obtaining a moral standard.</p>

<p>The question does not ordinarily arise in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>above form, because the moral standard is commonly
taken for granted, and the various impulses,
affections, and dispositions are made to derive their
ethical rank from their relation to that standard.
But this method is obviously inappropriate when
the standard is still to be ascertained, its determination
being the object of inquiry. And it may seem
that the constitution of man contains in itself a
means of distinguishing the moral value of its various
elements, or of the actions to which they lead,
and thus furnishing a <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>so as to determine
a standard for action.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
moral standard or end for
conduct. This purpose seems to have been to some
extent, though not quite clearly, kept in view by
the writers who, in last century, contended against
the selfish theory which had been so crudely enunciated
by Hobbes. They attempted to show that
selfishness was not the only, nor even the most
prominent, principle of action; and, from the
system of diverse principles which they found
implanted in human nature, they endeavoured to
work out a theory of conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This attempted
by the English moralists,</div>

<p>Especially amongst the later English moralists&mdash;Adam
Smith, for instance&mdash;the question of the
end or standard came almost to drop out of sight
in the midst of the controversy regarding the
nature of the "moral sense" or "moral faculty"&mdash;the
way, that is, in which we become aware of
the difference between right and wrong. But in
Shaftesbury, Butler, and Hutcheson&mdash;the writers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
who formulated this doctrine of the moral sense&mdash;the
attempt is made to connect a theory of the
criterion of morality with the source of our knowledge
of it. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>but along
with a utilitarian
criterion,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Shaftesbury and Hutcheson both
looked upon social welfare or the general happiness
as the end of moral conduct, and the criterion in
accordance with which moral character is ascribed
to actions; at the same time that their main contention
was for the immediateness of the "sense"
by which we perceive these moral qualities. And
they sought to establish the connection of the two
doctrines by means of the benevolent feelings&mdash;which
they held to be original and independent of
private interest&mdash;and their immediate approval by
the reflex or moral sense of the individual man.
Similar ideas appear in Butler, at the same time
that he tended to make conscience or the moral
sense the standard of morality, as well as the
source of our knowledge of it. They, as well as
he, however, found it necessary to come back from
the social or political to the individual point of
view. Even if their conception of "the good" was
not evolved from the nature of the individual man,
their philosophical standpoint required them to
leave broader ground, and show it to be the individual's
natural goal. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>and with
egoistic arguments.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
And in doing this, their
constant tendency is to revert to egoistic arguments&mdash;demonstrating
the complete harmony of
virtue and interest, or attempting to prove to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
individual that his own happiness consists in the
exercise of the social affections. Thus Shaftesbury
tries to show, by an empirical collection of results,
that to have the "natural" (or social) affections too
weak, or the private affections too strong, is a source
of misery,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> as well as the chief source of vice; and
that, largely owing to the pleasure of virtuous
action, it is "to the private interest and good of
every one to work to the general good."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Hutcheson,
again, devotes a large portion of his most
mature work to allay the suspicion "that in following
the impulse of our kind affections and the
moral faculty we are counteracting our interests,
and abandoning what may be of more consequence
to our happiness than either this self-approbation
or the applauses of others;"<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> while Butler, referring
to virtuous conduct, says, in a well-known
passage, that "when we sit down in a cool hour we

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>to avoid the judgment passed upon them by

<div class="sidenote">3. Ethics
may be made
to depend
on the moral
sense.</div>

<p>At the same time, their writings constantly suggest
a theory of morals which is neither obliged to
adopt off-hand a utilitarian criterion of virtue, nor
forced to fall back upon the egoistic sanctions of
personal pleasure and pain. Their psychological
theory points to an ethical doctrine in which
pleasure is neither the sole end of action, nor its
sole motive. They do not, indeed, make quite clear
the transition from the psychological to the ethical
point of view; and critics are still fond of confronting
Butler with the objection he anticipated&mdash;Why
ought I to obey my conscience? The apparent
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petitio principii</i> of Butler's answer, Because it is
the law of your nature, is due to the way in which
the teleological standpoint is introduced. The purpose
of which (according to Butler) man is the
vehicle or realising organism is spoken of as a law
externally imposed, and deriving its authority, not
from its own nature, but from the nature of its
origin.</p>

<p>There would seem to be one way only to surmount
the difficulty arising from the variety of
impulses of which the nature of man is made up,
and that is by consistently following out the teleological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>point of view. But what, the question is,
is the final or comprehensive end to which human
nature points amidst this diversity of objects of
striving? The doctrine of the "moral sense"
attempts to answer the question. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Different
views of the nature of the moral
sense.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Now this moral
sense may either be regarded as not itself a separate
faculty, but simply an expression for the harmony
of human tendencies; or it may be looked upon as
a separate and superior capacity, which, again, may
either be interpreted in terms of sense, or of the
understanding&mdash;the former interpretation leading
to its identification with pleasure, the latter to its
being conceived as law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) The harmony
of
impulses.
Shaftesbury's
theory.</div>

<p>These different methods were attempted by the
English moralists&mdash;the first, however, to a less
extent than the others. But it inspired much of
Shaftesbury's work, though it cannot be said to
have been consistently developed by him. The
conflict of impulses in man was too obvious a fact
not to be apparent even in Shaftesbury's roseate
view of life. He recognised, indeed, not only
private or self-affections, promoting the good of
the individual, and "natural" or social affections,
which led to the public good, but also "unnatural
affections," which tended to no good whatever.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
The reference to consequences is thus made prominent
at once. The last class of affections is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>condemned outright because of its infelicific results;
while an attempt is made to prove from
experience that the courses of conduct to which
the two former lead coincide. Shaftesbury contended
for a real organic union between the individual
and society; but, when he came to establish
its nature, he made it consist in an asserted harmony
of interests, while the obligation to virtue
was allowed to rest on its conduciveness to personal
pleasure. He sometimes spoke of virtue as identical
with the harmonious development of the affections of
the individual man;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> but he expressly defined it as
consisting in the individual "having all his inclinations
and affections ... agreeing with the good of
his kind or of that system in which he is included,
and of which he constitutes a part."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> And the
two views can only be connected by proving that
the harmonious development of an individual's
affections will lead to the good of the species: the
proof of this depending on a one-sided summation
of consequences. Shaftesbury does, indeed, throw
out the idea that both the self-affections and the
"natural" or social affections become self-destructive
when carried out so as to interfere with one
another. But this, again, has only the previous
calculus of the results of conduct to support it. He
cannot show that the contradiction in the conception
of a completely solitary being belongs also to the conception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>of a judiciously selfish being. The latter
being loses the pleasures of virtuous action; but
perhaps he may gain greater pleasures in their room.
He does not develop his whole nature; but if that nature
contains totally infelicific passions, the development
of the whole nature is not to be recommended.</p>

<p>Thus Shaftesbury is unable to reach a conception
of man's nature as a harmony of impulses just on
account of the external point of view which makes
him treat it as an aggregate, though he contends
that it is an organism. His ingenious and subtle
account of the relations between the individual
and society does not really go to the root of the
matter, because, after all, it remains a calculus of
the results of action, not an analysis of its nature.
And his view of the affections constituting the
individual system leaves them wanting in the
unity of organic connection. An effort is made,
however, to supply this defect by means of the
reflex affections called the "moral sense," to which
he ascribes an oversight over the other affections
and their resultant actions. In what way, then,
must we regard the nature of this faculty and the
important functions assigned to it?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) A separate
faculty.
Hutcheson.</div>

<p>It was left to Shaftesbury's disciple, Francis
Hutcheson, to elaborate with thoroughness this
conception of the moral sense as a separate faculty.
Hutcheson did not make any important addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to the ideas of Shaftesbury and Butler. But he
worked them out more systematically; and in his
last work, the 'System of Moral Philosophy,' the
protest against the egoism of Hobbes has found
expression in a complete theory of human nature,
in which the "moral sense" is supreme, and the
ends of conduct independent of self-interest.
Hutcheson, too, keeps more closely than either
of his immediate predecessors to the way of looking
at human nature which is spoken of in this
volume as "naturalistic." He rejects even more
decidedly than Shaftesbury&mdash;much more so than
Butler&mdash;any creative function of reason in determining
the constitution and direction of the moral
sense.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Two questions
regarding
it:<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The questions thus arise&mdash;(<i>a</i>) What is the
moral sense when not regarded as a rational determination
of the ends of conduct? and (<i>b</i>) To what
determination of ends or other distinction between
right and wrong in action does it lead? On both
these points there is a difference between his early
'Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty
and Virtue' (1725), and the more mature 'System,'
published in 1755, eight years after his death.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">(α) Nature of
this faculty:
not reason;</div>

<p>Hutcheson is in earnest with the rejection of
reason as a creative force. The moral sense is not,
he says, a source of new ideas. Its objects are
received in the ordinary ways by which, through
"sensation and reflection," we come by our knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
But just as we have a sense of beauty in
the forms of sensible objects, so there is a moral
sense given us from which, in the contemplation of
our actions, we derive "still nobler pleasures" than
those of physical sensation. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>at first defined
as feeling of pleasure or pain,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This moral sense is
"a determination of our minds to receive amiable
or disagreeable ideas of actions."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> So far, therefore,
it seems to be simply a pleasure in the contemplation
of certain actions which, we say, have
"an immediate goodness." "By a superior sense,"
says Hutcheson, "which I call a moral one, we
perceive pleasure in the contemplation of such
actions in others, and are determined to love the
agent (and much more do we perceive pleasure in
being conscious of having done such actions ourselves)
without any view of further natural advantage
from them."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The significance of this position
is easily seen. It is not only meant to give a
criterion of moral action; it is also a short cut to
the conclusion that virtue is for our private interest.
The disquieting suspicion that morality
may involve a sacrifice of individual happiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>"must be entirely removed, if we have a moral
sense and public affections, whose gratifications are
constituted by nature our most intense and durable
pleasures."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The elaborate analysis of conduct and
enumeration of the pleasures which various affections
and actions bring in their train, which
Hutcheson gave in his latest work, were thus
unnecessary as long as the position was maintained
that the moral sense is emphatically a pleasure or
pain, and that the pleasures it gives are the most
intense and durable we have.</p>

<p>There was only an apparent contradiction in this
theory which placed the test of morality in a pleasure
consequent upon moral action, and yet held
that such actions were not performed from interested
motives. In the spirit of Butler's psychology,
Hutcheson contends<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> that virtue is pleasant only
because we have a natural and immediate tendency
towards virtuous action; our true motive is "some
determination of our nature to study the good of
others;" and this, although not always immediately
pleasant in itself, is yet succeeded by the calm
satisfaction of the moral sense. The real weakness
of Hutcheson's position is the fatal one that he
cannot show that it corresponds with facts; that
the pleasures incidental to the moral sense outweigh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>all others. Indeed, he defends his opinion
in their favour only, in a way which reminds one
of Mill's method in the 'Utilitarianism,' by making
every juror stand aside unless he has pledged himself
to morality.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> It is open to any one, however,
to hold that the pleasures of benevolent action and
the "relish" of the moral sense are not of sufficient
hedonistic value to make up for the restraints they
put upon conduct and the enjoyments they oblige
one to forego. Even if this position be not correct,
it is merely a mistake in estimating doubtful quantities.
The man who chooses the smaller pleasure
will be the loser by his mistake; but we cannot
say that the selfish man is to blame for not being
benevolent, because the pleasures of benevolence
and the moral sense are greatest, any more than
we could blame the benevolent man for not being
selfish, if selfishness should turn out on the whole
to leave a greater hedonistic balance at the individual's
credit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">afterwards
spoken of as
a judgment,</div>

<p>A more objective determination of the moral
sense is afterwards given by Hutcheson. Without
professedly changing ground, he ceases to speak of
it as a mere feeling of pleasure, and calls it a judgment
of approbation or disapprobation. "It is," he
says,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> "a natural and immediate determination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>to approve certain affections and actions consequent
upon them; or a natural sense of immediate excellence
in them, not referred to any other quality
perceivable by our other senses or by reasoning."
Nor is this judgment of approbation consequent
upon the feeling of pleasure the affection or action
produces in us. The action is not "judged good
because it gains to the agent the pleasure of self-approbation,
but it gains to him this pleasure because
it was antecedently good, or had that quality
which, by the constitution of this sense, we must
approve."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>but this
judgment allowed to depend on
feeling.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But, in attempting to make clear the
nature of this judgment, Hutcheson seems to return,
though not in so many words, to his earlier
position. To seek a basis for the judgment in reason
would have been to make the "moral sense" what
Kant afterwards made it, simply practical reason.
This, however, would have been a "metaphysic
of ethics" inconsistent with Hutcheson's whole
position. He had always opposed the narrowly
intellectual view of morality in Clarke and Wollaston,
and he had no conception of the function of
reason which would admit of an interpretation of
the judgment of approbation by an appeal to a
rational determination, depending upon an idea
conceived as inherent in the human constitution,
and to be realised in action. The judgment, therefore,
is referred to a "taste or relish"<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> for certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>affections and actions, and this he takes no pains
to distinguish from pleasure.</p>

<p>The analogy he seeks to draw between the moral
sense and our other powers does not really favour
a distinction of it from pleasure. "To each of our
powers," he says, "we seem to have a corresponding
taste or sense, recommending the proper use of it
to the agent, and making him relish or value the
like exercise of it by another. This we see as to
the powers of voice, of imitation, designing, or
machinery, motion, reasoning; there is a sense
discerning or recommending the proper exercise
of them."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> That is to say, besides the sense of
hearing, which has to do with sounds, there must
needs be another sense which has to do with our
way of hearing sounds; besides the sense of sight,
which has to do with form and colour, there must
needs be another sense which has to do with our
way of perceiving form and colour; and so with
every other activity, especially those which proceed
from our "highest powers." A doctrine such as this
sets no limits to the manufacture of additional senses.
The whole view of human nature upon which it proceeds
is one of meaningless complexity, which serves
the one good purpose only of showing how much
ethics has suffered from a defective psychology.</p>

<p>The mental objects or presentations which are
distinguished from one another by the difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>of their characteristic qualities, and which we
therefore call colours, or sounds, or movements,
are accompanied by varying degrees of pleasurable
or painful feeling; and it is possible to hold that
the moral sense is a name for such feelings following
in the train of those complexes of presentations
to which we give the name of actions, or of those
other recurring complexes we call affections. This,
practically, was the position with which Hutcheson
started in the 'Inquiry.' Benevolence pleased us
and selfishness pained us; just as the taste of
sugar was pleasant, and that of wormwood disagreeable.
Perhaps Hutcheson departed from this
theory, because he saw that if conduct was made a
matter of taste, there would be no sufficient reason
for condemning selfishness any more than an unusual
taste. He therefore relinquished, or seems to
have relinquished, the view of the moral sense as a
feeling of pleasure or pain; and under the influence,
no doubt, of Butler, spoke of it as a judgment of
approbation or disapprobation. But he fell back on
his original theory by making this judgment depend
on "a taste or relish," which only lends itself to
interpretation as a peculiar feeling of pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(β) The objects
of the
moral sense:
first said to
be actions;</div>

<p>The reflex nature of the moral sense is brought
out more distinctly in the 'System' than in the
'Inquiry.' In his earlier work, Hutcheson had
spoken of it as directly related to <i>actions</i>. But
it was more consistent with his maturer thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to regard it as having to do with mental powers
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>afterwards
to be affections;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
or "affections" in the first instance, and with
actions only indirectly or mediately. "The object
of this sense," he says,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> "is not any external motion
or action, but the inward affections or dispositions;"
and this is made by him to account for the discrepancy
which the deliverances of the moral sense
show in regard to actions. It "seems ever to
approve and condemn uniformly the same immediate
objects, the same affections and dispositions;
though we reason very differently about the actions
which evidence certain dispositions or their contraries."
This distinction is applied with unlimited
confidence in its efficacy. By means of it he would
explain the most fundamental differences in the
moral code of men and nations. Thus people unacquainted
with the industrial improvements which
give the character of permanence to property, may
"see no harm in depriving men of their artificial
acquisitions and stores beyond their present use,"&mdash;that
is to say, "no evil may appear in theft."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>But it is more important in another respect; for
it enables the author to avoid the difficulty of
finding any principle according to which the moral
sense may be related to the empirical content of
action. As long as the moral sense was simply
spoken of as a feeling of pleasure, it could be
conveniently regarded as the consequent of external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>actions. But if it is an internal sense
distinct from pleasure, it is easier to relate it to
what he calls our internal powers or affections
than to action. The moral sense, then, is to be
the regulator of all our powers; and by means of
it Hutcheson attempts to reduce human nature to
a scale of morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but its
grounds of
preference</div>

<p>It is to be noted that, in the classification he
offers,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> what are commonly called the virtues of
candour, veracity, &amp;c., are not accounted virtues
at all, but only immediately connected with virtuous
affections: these are identified with the "kind" or
benevolent affections, directed to the happiness of
sentient beings. Within the latter there are two
grounds of preference: the deliberate affections are
preferred to the passionate; those which are more
extensive in the range of their objects to the less
extensive. With regard to the former ground of
preference, the "moral sense" of the community has
perhaps undergone some modification since Hutcheson's
time, and looks upon enthusiasm with less
suspicion than it formerly did. The other ground
of preference ascribed to the moral sense refers not
so much to the affection itself&mdash;which is the direct
or immediate object of the moral sense&mdash;as to the
way in which the affection is applied, the number
of the objects to which it is directed. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>mainly depend
not on the nature of the affection, but on
its objects.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The affection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>of benevolence is the same in nature whether
its object be wide or restricted; though difference
in this respect profoundly influences the actions to
which it leads. The object approved or most approved
by the moral sense is therefore, according
to Hutcheson, utilitarian conduct, or rather, as he
would say, the calm disposition leading thereto.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In
this way he obtains a principle for determining the
morality of actions; but only through the arbitrary
assertion that this principle is immediately approved
by the moral sense. The connection of the
moral sense with an object such as universal benevolence
could only be made out by showing a
rational, or at any rate an organic union between
individual sentiment and social wellbeing; and
Hutcheson, like Shaftesbury, has no conception of
attempting this in any other way than the traditional
one of exhibiting the personal advantages of
benevolent conduct, and the disadvantages that
accompany selfishness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) Third
view of the
moral sense.</div>

<p>Both Shaftesbury and Hutcheson were often led
astray by a tendency to interpret facts as they
wished them to be, rather than as they were.
Their view of the consequences of action was
coloured by their optimism. Butler, too, <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Butler.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
in spite
of the difference in his general attitude to the
value of human life, was not altogether free from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>a similar error. He thinks that Shaftesbury "has
shown beyond all contradiction that virtue is naturally
the interest of happiness, and vice the misery
of such a creature as man."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> But, in view of particular
exceptions, or of any one not being convinced
of "this happy tendency of virtue," he
thinks it necessary to emphasise the "natural<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Conscience
an authoritative
law,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
authority of the principle of reflection." Conscience
is, he holds, a part of our inward nature;
but it differs from the other parts of our nature
inasmuch as it is not related immediately to an
external object, but to the actions dealing with
such objects, and to the dispositions leading to
those actions. It is a principle of "reflex approbation
or disapprobation," which is said to have
equal respect to both public and private good.
This tendency, however, would seem to be ascertained
empirically. The deliverances of conscience
are immediate judgments as to the morality of
actions and affections (for Butler speaks of it as
referring to both equally); and its reference to
the ends which those actions or the exercise of
these affections may ultimately tend to would,
therefore, seem to be indirect.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Butler was careful,
moreover, not to speak of it as an æsthetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>or sensitive faculty, but as a judgment. It is not
a feeling of pleasure, but the revelation of law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and the
criterion
of morality.</div>

<p>The approval of conscience is thus made the
criterion of morality. But a difficulty arises as
to the way in which we are to regard the authority
which conscience is said to carry along with
it. Butler's utterances here commonly imply a
teleological reference to an end implanted in human
nature, and to be discovered by observing that
nature&mdash;the realisation of the end being obligatory,
because it is shown to be the purpose which
the author of nature had in view in making man
as he is.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The authority of conscience thus seems
to be derived from the divine purpose which it
displays. It carries within itself a claim to obedience;
but the justification of this claim depends
on a theological basis. And hence the question
of the nature and origin of conscience is at once
raised, in order to determine the legitimacy of its
claim to be, rather than any other part of our
constitution, a divinely-implanted guide.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Teleological
and jural
views not
reconciled,
nor fully
developed.</div>

<p>But more than one current of thought runs
through Butler's ethical treatise. The theological
reference is sometimes so used as to make the
obligation to morality, and even the nature of
morality, depend on the will of God: though
hardly according to Paley's crude method of seeking
in the external revelation of the divine command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>a means of uniting the divergent interests
of the individual and of society. In general,
Butler's ruling idea is the idea of the system or
unity of human nature, for which he was largely
indebted to Shaftesbury's revival of the Platonic
conception. Conscience is regarded by him as the
expression of this unity. But its nature is never
more deeply probed. Its deliverances are justified
now by its supernatural mission, and now by the
more prosaic fact that it leads to our individual

<div class="sidenote">4. The ethics
of moral sentiment
a mediating
theory;</div>

<p>On the whole, it would appear that the psychological
ethics worked out by Shaftesbury and his
school occupies an insecure position between the
view discussed in the two preceding chapters and
that which ascribes to reason a function in the
formation of objects of desire. Shaftesbury and
his followers tried to strike out a middle course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>between the theory that ends of action may be
determined by reason, and that which looks upon
all desires as being desires for objects as pleasurable.
They made the attempt to found a system
of ethics on human nature, and they held that
that nature could not be accounted for by the
simple psychological analysis of the Epicurean
school as then represented by Hobbes. On the
other hand, they did not see their way to adopt
the "rational" ethics only known to them in the
abstract form it had received at the hands of
Clarke and Wollaston. But their own theory of
human nature requires a principle of harmony and
co-ordination among the various impulses which
they were unable to give a satisfactory account
of. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>explanation
of its facts attempted by theory of
evolution.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It may seem, however, that the idea of the
development of man with which we are now
familiar, may enable us to overcome the difficulties
which formerly appeared insurmountable&mdash;showing
the unity of human nature, and the tendency
of its activity. The general course of evolution,
to which all life has been subject, is thought
to have brought about a harmony between individual
and social feelings, as well as between
individual and social interests, and thus to have
removed the obstacles in the way of founding
morality on the basis of Naturalism. It is, therefore,
of importance to examine with care the ethical
bearings of the theory of evolution.</p>

THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION.</p>


<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF MORALITY.</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">1. General
characteristics
of the
theory of
evolution:</div>

<p>To relinquish the individualistic theory of ethics
does not necessarily imply a recourse to evolution.
It may still be possible to rest the foundation of
ethics on the state, without that view of the
growth of the community and of its connection
with the individual which the theory of evolution
involves. This, as has already been pointed out,
was, in part, what Bentham did; while an attempt&mdash;in
some respects more elaborate still&mdash;to deduce
morality from society was made by Hobbes. The
theory of Bentham, and of his successor Professor
Bain, is indeed partly individualistic, partly social.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>In the former reference, ethics becomes a theory of
prudence; in the latter, a part of legislation. With
Hobbes, on the other hand, the identification of
individual and social interests is supposed to be
brought about by the absolute necessity, in order
to personal security, of a supreme political power,
into the hands of which all men have agreed to
transfer their rights to all things. But both
Hobbes and Professor Bain might have avoided
obvious difficulties had they had the theory of
evolution to assist them, and had they thought
themselves justified in making use of it.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> For
want of it the former has to explain morality and
its binding force by means of the fiction of an
"original contract"; while the latter has to account
by the associations of a few years for the
harmony of feeling between the individual and the
whole, and for the good of the community coming
to be so faithfully reflected in the consciences of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>members. The theory of evolution, by its doctrine
of the hereditary transmission of acquired modifications,
gives a scientific basis for this existing
solidarity between man and society.</p>

<p>The great consensus of opinion amongst those
who are best qualified to judge&mdash;amongst those
who alone are qualified to judge&mdash;may be regarded
as having established the claim of the theory of
evolution to give the most satisfactory account of
all forms of natural life. And it may seem only
advancing the theory a step further, or only developing
one of its applications, to make it yield a
complete explanation of human nature, mental as
well as physical. If ethics, then, is to be founded
on a "natural" basis, no theory would seem to be
complete which leaves evolution out of account.</p>

<div class="sidenote">an assertion
of the unity
of life;</div>

<p>In general, the theory of evolution is an assertion
of the unity of life, or, in its widest form, of the
unity of existence. Progressive modifications and
hereditary transmission of such modifications are,
it is contended, sufficient to explain the different
forms and species which life now manifests. The
assumption is specially discarded that there are
fixed differences between kinds of living things
making it impossible for them all to have developed
from simple germs, originally of like constitution,
which have, in the course of time, become more
heterogeneous and complex, and so given rise to
the wealth of organic life. But this general doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
held (wholly or in part) in modern times by
Kant, Wolff, and Lamarck, needed to be supplemented
by a definite view of the way in which the
progressive modifications took place; and this required
to be established as a really operative
cause, before evolution could receive scientific
proof. This more special element of the theory
was Darwin's contribution to the subject. Evolution,
he showed,&mdash;and herein consists his theoretical
advance on Lamarck,&mdash;has taken place by the
"natural selection" of organisms, so modified as to
fit them for survival in the struggle for existence.
Organisms in which advantageous modifications
have been produced tend to survive, and to transmit
their modified structure to descendants, while
organisms in which such modifications have not
been produced, are less able to preserve their life
and to hand it on to successors. Older types, it is
true, remain, but only in circumstances in which
their continued existence does not seriously interfere
with the organisms which, in the struggle for
life, have developed a structure better suited to
their environment: when more perfect and less
perfect forms cannot exist together, only the better
adapted survive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">in first instance,
historical;</div>

<p>The theory of evolution is thus primarily the
history of an order of sequent facts and relations.
It is an account of the origin or growth of things,
which attempts to explain their nature and constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
by showing how they have come to be what
they are. But, in so doing, it naturally reveals the
method and tendency of this order. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>but implies
a teleological aspect, which may have ethical
consequences.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
And it is by
means of this its teleological aspect that we see how
it may be possible for it not merely to trace the development
of historical facts, such as the feelings
and customs of men, but at the same time to make
a more real contribution to ethics by pointing out
the course of action to which human nature is
adapted. It does not, like the old teleology, attempt
to show that each thing has been formed
with the design of subserving some particular
purpose. On the contrary, it reverses this way of
looking at things. The fitness of an organism to
fulfil any definite end comes to be regarded as the
result not of a conscious design, independent of the
environment, but of the modifications produced on
the organism through the necessity laid upon it by
its surroundings of adapting itself to them or else
disappearing. What the theory does show is, that
adaptation to environment is necessary for life, and
that organisms unable to adapt themselves pass
away. Adaptation to environment will thus be
implied in, or be an essential means towards, self-preservation
and race-preservation, self-development
and race-development. And should this preservation
or development be looked upon as the end
of conduct, the adaptation to environment it implies
may help to define and characterise the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Again: when an organism adapts itself to its environment,
it does so by some modification being
produced in its structure corresponding to the modified
function required by the conditions of life. In
this way, one organism increases in complexity in a
certain direction, while another organism, in different
circumstances, also develops a more complicated
structure, though one of a different kind.
Thus organisms, alike to begin with, become heterogeneous
in nature through exposure to different
surroundings. At the same time, by constant interaction
with their environments, they become
more definite and coherent in structure. Incipient
modifications are developed and defined in different
ways by different circumstances, and the parts of a
living being are brought into closer reciprocal relations,
and thus welded into a coherent organic
whole. This is what Mr Spencer means when he
says that evolution implies a transition from "an
indefinite incoherent homogeneity to a definite coherent
heterogeneity":<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> the whole process being
interconnected in such a way that these different
aspects of it&mdash;definiteness, coherence, heterogeneity&mdash;increase
together and imply one another. By
this the inference would appear to be suggested
that, if conduct is to harmonise with the conditions
of evolution, this characteristic feature of it must
be recognised in the ethical end.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Distinction
of its historical
and
ethical
aspects.</div>

<p>In saying this, I am perhaps anticipating results.
But it is well to show at the outset how the essentially
historical inquiry carried out by the evolutionists
may suggest conclusions which are ethical
in their nature. To some, indeed, it will appear
superfluous to have spent even a sentence in suggesting
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ facie</i> case for the ethical importance
of evolution. If there is one subject more than
another, it may be thought, which has secured a
place for itself in the scientific consciousness of the
day, it is the evolution-theory of ethics. Without
question, the phrase has been received into the
scientific vocabulary; but there is a good deal, even
in the official literature on the question, to make
one doubt whether it is always used with a distinct
conception of its meaning. When reference is made
to the "ethics of evolution," no more is sometimes
meant&mdash;though a great deal more should be meant&mdash;than
an historical account of the growth of moral
ideas and customs, which may provide (as Mr
Stephen expresses it) "a new armoury wherewith
to encounter certain plausible objections of the
so-called Intuitionists." This, however, would only
affect the ethical psychology of an opposed school.
The profounder question still remains, What bearing
has the theory of evolution, or its historical
psychology and sociology, on the nature of the ethical
end, or on the standard for distinguishing right and
wrong in conduct? The answer to this question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
will be the "reconstruction" and "deeper change"
which Mr Stephen holds to be necessary.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> It is
the ambiguity of the subject&mdash;or rather its twofold
range&mdash;which has made the application of evolution
to ethics look so obvious, and made a discussion of
the easier question frequently do duty for a solution
of the more difficult. The ethical writings of the
evolutionists, indeed, often confuse the problems of
history and theory in a way which presents the
same difficulty to the critic as the works of the corresponding
school in jurisprudence. In both, the
writers seem disinclined fairly to put to themselves
the question as to the kind of subjects to which so
fruitful a method as that which has fallen into their
hands is appropriate: what its conditions are, and
whether it has any limits at all. Every one is now
familiar with the evils of hypothetical history, and
with the iniquity of the proverbial philosophic
offence of constructing facts out of one's inner consciousness.
The historical jurists deserve no little
credit for the thoroughness with which this has
been enforced by them; perhaps, too, the same lesson
may be learned from the facts of the development
of morality. But it may be questioned whether
we are not at the present time more apt to confuse
fact and theory in the opposite way: whether the
science of law is not sometimes lost sight of in the
history of legal institutions, and ethics in danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>of being identified with the development of moral
sentiments and customs.</p>

<p>We may naturally expect the theory of evolution
to throw light on such questions as the growth of
moral feelings and ideas, and of the customs and
institutions in which morality is expressed and
embodied. But to show the process morality has
passed through in the individual mind and in society
still leaves the question as to the end of conduct
unanswered. It is necessary, therefore, to keep
clearly before us the distinction between the historical
and the ethical problem, if we would successfully
attack the subject of the bearing of the theory
of evolution on this fundamental question of ethics.
To the theory of evolution we are indebted for the
opening up of a new field of investigation&mdash;the historical
treatment of conduct. But it is one thing
to describe the way in which men have acted in the
past: to determine the end for their action now is
quite a different problem; and there is no reason why
the distinction should be overlooked. The interest
which belongs to the history of morality is not
solely nor mainly due to its bearing on questions
beyond the historical sphere. That its results will
not be without relation&mdash;and that of an important
kind&mdash;to questions of theory may well be expected.
But it can only tend to confusion if we treat the
development of morality, in the human mind and
in society, from a preconceived attitude&mdash;dogmatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
or agnostic&mdash;towards the central problem of
ethics.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">2. The development
of morality:
(<i>a</i>) historical
psychology.</div>

<p>The way in which the theory of evolution is applied
to ethical psychology is easy enough to understand
in principle, though complex and obscure in
many of its details. We have only to postulate
that mental as well as bodily traits admit of modification,
and that modifications once produced can
be transmitted to descendants,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and it at once follows
that sentiments and ideas leading to actions
which promote life will be encouraged and developed
by natural selection. Thus parental and filial
feelings, once originated, may have been developed
through those families and tribes in which they
were strongest, presenting a more united, and
therefore stronger, front against hostile influences.
The feelings of tribal sympathy and patriotism, too,
may have had a similar history. Those races in
which they were strongest would, other things
being equal, obtain the mastery over and exterminate
other races in which they were relatively weak.
The compactness of the community would even be
promoted by that fear of the political and of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>religious control in which the feeling of obligation
is said to have had its root. In general, benevolence
and sympathy amongst a people give it a solidarity
from which it derives a stronger position, so
that in turn the benevolent and sympathetic feelings
gain free scope to develop and expand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its difficulties:
the
origin of
new feelings,</div>

<p>But the working out of this theory is not without
its own difficulties. In the first place, the factor
in the theory of evolution which can be most
clearly traced&mdash;the principle of natural selection&mdash;is
not itself a source of change or of the production
of new results. It is only the means by which
advantageous changes are preserved and disadvantageous
changes passed by. The initiative in these
changes comes either from the unequal pressure of
the environment or from some tendency to vary in
the organism itself. Now, if we suppose certain
moral relations and the feelings corresponding to
them to exist in a society, and to tend to greater
certainty and fulness of life on the part of those
who possess them, such relations and feelings will
be favoured by the operation of natural selection,
and will gradually be assimilated into the tissue of
the social organism. But this does not account for
the origin of morality generally nor of any particular
moral relation; it merely shows how, having
been somehow originated, it has naturally come to
persist. There are thus really two points to be
considered in tracing the development of moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
ideas&mdash;the question of origin and the question of
persistence. The latter is accounted for by natural
selection; the former must be brought under the
obscure laws of variation, laws so obscure that
variations in nature are frequently spoken of as if
they took place by chance. These two questions
are involved at each stage in the progress of
morality. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>and of the
moral consciousness;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But it is at the initial stage that the
question of origin is of greatest importance: when
the attempt is made to show how, in the course of
time, and by the aid of purely physical and biological
laws, feelings and conduct, from being merely
natural and reflex, have acquired a moral character&mdash;when,
in a word, the moral is being evolved out
of the non-moral. A difficulty comes to the front
here which scarcely arises when we are simply
tracing the various phases through which the moral
consciousness has passed, and the various forms in
which moral conduct and feelings have expressed
and embodied themselves. The latter subject is
obviously within the scope of the theory of evolution,
if that theory applies to the processes of
the human mind and society as well as to those of
external nature. And, although each stage involves
a modification to be accounted for not by natural
selection, but by the laws of variation, yet the
variation is within facts of the same order, and
creates no more difficulty than the successive modifications
of living tissue which have been implied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in the evolution of organic nature. But the transition
from the non-moral to the moral is a transition
to a different order of facts or&mdash;perhaps we should
rather say&mdash;to a different way of looking at facts,
and should not be assumed to be a process of the
same kind and explicable by the same method of
investigation as the passage from one fact to the
similar fact which immediately follows it. It may
be compared, perhaps, to the transition from the
sphere of inorganic matter to that of life. At the
same time, it is frequently maintained that we
unduly limit the application of the law of evolution
if we deny its power to show how morality has
developed out of customs and institutions whose
origin can be traced to purely natural or non-moral
causes. And, for present purposes, it is
sufficient to have pointed out that this does not
necessarily follow from the admission that evolution
applies to mental and social processes as well as
to the facts of external nature. It is not my object
to criticise any doctrine of the development of morality;
but, starting with the position taken up with
regard to it by the theory of evolution, to inquire
what conclusions it may lead to as to the end of
action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">the development
of feelings
apart
from natural
selection.</div>

<p>A further difficulty has to be met by the theory
of the development of morality, which is in a sense
complementary of the initial difficulty encountered
in differentiating the moral from the non-moral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
This further difficulty awaits it at a subsequent
stage of development when the extension and refinement
of moral feeling seem to have gone on in
circumstances where there is no room for natural
selection to work. Thus it has been admitted that
the feeling of sympathy, and the habitual exercise
of mutual good offices among members of a community,
strengthen that society, and make it fit
to prevail in the struggle for existence over other
similar societies, the members of which are not so
much at one amongst themselves in feeling and
in act.</p>

<p>But as benevolence and sympathy widen, and
become less closely connected with a definite
association of individuals, such as the family or
tribe, and there ceases to be a particular body to
the welfare of which these social feelings contribute,
the operation of the law of natural selection
becomes less certain. This law only tends to conserve
and perfect the feelings in question, in virtue
of the fact that the associations to whose good they
lead are successful in the struggle for life over
other associations the members of which are not
animated by like feelings. The one association
lives and expands, while the others are unable to
maintain themselves against the encroachments of
their neighbours, and thus fall to pieces. The law
of natural selection, therefore, comes into play only
when there are competing organisms struggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
against one another for the means of subsistence
and development. Not only is it the case, therefore,
that the sympathy which aids the weak who are
unable to take care of themselves, does not seem to
be of the kind that would contribute to success in
the struggle for existence; but the more general
and catholic our sympathies are, the less will the
law of evolution help to preserve and develop
them&mdash;because the less will they tend to promote
the welfare of one rival association rather than
that of another. Thus the growth of really unrestricted
sympathy with men as men cannot have
been promoted in this way. The "enthusiasm of
humanity" which animated the early Christians,
the self-renouncing brotherhood of Buddha, the
<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">φιλανθρωπία</span> (~philanthrôpia~) attributed to men like Xenocrates<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> who
had freed themselves from the aristocratic prejudices
of Athens, the "caritas generis humani" of
the Stoics,&mdash;such feelings as these could not have
been encouraged, any more than they could have
been produced, by the operation of natural selection.
For, however much they tend to elevate the human
character, and to promote human happiness, they
do not advance the welfare of one body of men to
the exclusion of some other competitor in the
struggle for existence.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>But, although the law of natural evolution cannot
account, by survival of the fittest, for any
progress made by universal benevolence, yet it may
explain the value ascribed to the feeling of benevolence,
when its object is the family or the community.
Besides&mdash;as has already been pointed
out&mdash;natural selection always implies an initiative
got from elsewhere: it does not itself produce
modifications; it only chooses out favourable ones
and adds them together when produced. It always
implies an independent modification of the organism;
its part is to select the modifications best
fitted to promote life. Hence the mere fact of
benevolence being universalised is not in itself an
anomaly on the theory of natural selection, any
more than is the fact of its being extended from
the family to the tribe. Only, the latter extension
is one which it perpetuates, the former is not. No
aspect of the theory of evolution seems able to
account for an extension of the feeling of universal
benevolence among different people or throughout
different societies. This feeling has neither tended
to promote the welfare of the race animated by it
to the exclusion of other competing races&mdash;for
there are no competing races whom it could
affect&mdash;nor can it be shown that it makes the
individuals possessing it fitter to wage successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
war against opposing forces, than other individuals.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Its result:
shows the
social nature
of the individual.</div>

<p>Apart from such special difficulties, however,
comparative psychology has shed a new light on the
mental structure of the individual. The facts it
brings forward show that the nature of the individual
man cannot be explained without taking into account
the relations in which he stands to society by birth,
education, and business. He is, from the first, surrounded
by, and dependent upon, other individuals,
and by a set of established usages and institutions
which modify his life; and he is connected with
these in such a way that it is impossible to consider
him as merely acted upon by them and influencing
them in turn. He has been produced by, and has
become a part of them. His physical and mental
structure bears the marks of the same influences as
those by which his so-called environment has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>formed. He is cell in the "tissue" of which the body
social is composed. This was partly recognised, it
is true, before the theory of evolution had been
elaborated. But the organic nature of the social
union is confirmed by that theory, and erected into
a scientific view of human life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(b) Development
of
society.</div>

<p>Now the various sentiments which bring one man
into mental union with others act with greatest
facility when men are connected with one another
by some definite mutual bond such as that which
forms the family, the clan, or the nation. The
individual's feeling of sympathy with his neighbours
both promotes this social union and depends upon
it. But it is characteristic of the theory of evolution
to put the external aspect first&mdash;the social customs
and institutions&mdash;and to evolve from them the
corresponding sentiments and ideas. Not word or
thought or power, it holds, is to be regarded as the
origin of morality: "Im Anfang war die That." The
whole composed of these units bound together by
reciprocity of feeling and function is termed the
"social organism"; and what has been called moral
sociology shows the way in which the outward forms
which express and embody morality have grown up
and become part of it.</p>

<p>In this connection, the theory of natural evolution
traces the process by which, from the rudimentary
beginnings of society, the members composing it
have gradually become more coherent amongst one
another, related in definite ways instead of merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
by chance, and more differentiated in function.
Certain rudimentary forms&mdash;such as the family
(in its rudest structure)&mdash;and the corresponding
instincts are presupposed. And from this basis the
origin of institutions and customs, political, religious,
and industrial, is traced. In developing these
various customs and institutions, along with the
corresponding sentiments, the course of social evolution
has had the effect of gradually bringing out and
cultivating those feelings and tendencies in the individual
which promote the welfare of the organism,
while other individual tendencies, hostile to social
welfare, have been repressed. Not sympathy and
benevolence only, but honesty, temperance, justice,
and all the ordinary social and personal virtues, may
have their natural history traced in this way&mdash;by
showing how they have contributed to the life of the
individual, or of the society, or of both.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Through
the operation of purely natural laws, the wicked are
"cut off from the earth," while the "perfect remain in
it" and leave their possessions to their children. This
is an obvious result of natural selection. For those
communities are always fittest to survive in which
each member, in feeling and in act, is most at one
with the whole. The <i>tendency</i> of evolution seems to
be to produce not merely an ideal but an actual identification
of individual and social interests, in which
each man finds his own good in that of the state.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>EVOLUTION AND ETHICAL THEORIES.</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Bearing of
the theory
of evolution
on previous
ethical
theories.</div>

<p>Before going on to inquire into the positive contributions
to ethics which the theory of evolution
has to offer, it is necessary to consider the relation
it bears to the preceding individualistic systems of
morals. It was by way of investigations in psychology
and in the theory of society, that it first
began to influence ethical thought. And, at first
sight, it appeared to come as a natural ally of
one of the opposed schools, dreaded by the side
it opposed,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> welcomed with open arms by that
favoured with its friendship. But since the first
shock of pained and pleased surprise, there have
been rumours of dissension in the allies' camp;
and the distribution of parties has now become a
matter of difficulty. The doctrine of evolution,
first seized upon for rebutting the arguments of the
intuitional moralists, has been found to transform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>rather than to destroy their system; and the utilitarianism
in whose interests the new controversial
weapon was employed, seems to have been subjected
to a parallel process of transformation. The bearing
of evolution on egoism may appear to be even more
fundamental. For the inheritance by an individual
of the qualities acquired by his ancestors may be
thought to establish scientifically the theory of the
unity of the race, and, in doing so, to make the
selfish system of conduct an anachronism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. On theories
depending
on moral
sentiment
or intuition.</div>

<p>It is not necessary to examine at any length the
application of evolution to the theories which construct
ethical principles on the basis of moral sentiment,
because these theories have been found either
to resolve themselves into a subtle form of egoistic
hedonism, or else to rest their ethical system on
a teleological conception, which transcends the
"naturalistic" view of man. Evolution has its own
explanation to give of the seemingly intuitive character
of moral ideas&mdash;showing how their immediate
necessity for the individual of the present day may
be reconciled with their empirical origin in the
mental history of the race. It attempts thus to
supplant both egoism and intuitionism by the same
doctrine of the organic union between individuals.</p>

<p>The phenomena of conscience and the moral
sentiments had been brought forward to show
that the origin of morality was independent of the
experience of the pleasurable or painful results of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
action: that certain actions and traits of character
were immediately approved and pronounced to be
right by the individual conscience, and certain
others as inexplicably but infallibly disapproved
and pronounced to be wrong. This phenomenon of
moral approbation or disapprobation had indeed
been thought by some&mdash;as has been already seen&mdash;to
be only a special feeling of pleasure or pain.
Even as such, however, it pointed to a peculiar
harmony or sympathy between the feelings of the
individual and the fortunes of society. For the
pleasure or pain of the individual was seen to be
excited by actions and dispositions which might be
shown to involve the common interests, but were
without relation to his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin and
history of
moral sentiments
and
intuitions
traced by
evolution.</div>

<p>Even on the "empirical" interpretation of them,
such facts of the individual mind were in need of
explanation; and the theory of evolution has taken
in hand to show how the pre-established harmony
grew up. The results of this explanation
are, of course, not put forward as explaining the
facts away, or depriving them of reality, but as
enabling us to see their true place and bearing in
the economy of human nature. In tracing the
origin and history of the "altruistic" and "moral"
sentiments of the individual, the theory of evolution
has this end in view. It offers&mdash;so it is often said&mdash;terms
of compromise between the "intuitional"
and the "empirical" psychology of morals. It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
admit the immediate and intuitive character in the
individual of the sentiments which older empiricism
had tried to make out to be composite, growing up
in each person out of the materials afforded by his
environment, and the experiences to which he was
subjected. The theory of evolution contends for
an empiricism on a larger scale, which will more
closely connect the individual with the race, and
both with their environment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bearing of
this on their
validity:</div>

<p>The question thus arises, What bearing has this
psychological or "psychogonical" theory on the
ethical validity of moral intuitions and sentiments?
It certainly does not follow that they are of no
moral value, merely because their origin can be
traced to simpler elements of experience. They
would lose ethical importance only if it were first
of all shown that their validity depended on their
not being derived from, or compounded out of,
other elements. As Professor Sidgwick says, "Those
who dispute the authority of moral or other intuitions
on the ground of their derivation, must be
required to show, not merely that they are the
effects of certain causes, but that these causes are
of a kind that tend to produce invalid belief."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>But what the theory of evolution has to determine
with regard to moral intuitions or sensibilities
would seem to be not so much their
ethical validity or invalidity, as the range and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>manner of their ethical application. It attempts
to show that particular moral beliefs or feelings
have been originated and formed by certain
external customs belonging to the conditions of
social or family life. These customs have impressed
themselves upon the mental structure, and
reappear in the individual in the shape of organic
tendencies to certain actions, or classes of actions,
and of aversion to other actions, accompanied by
a corresponding mental sentiment&mdash;or judgment&mdash;of
approbation or disapprobation. Thus the individual
comes instinctively to feel&mdash;or to judge,&mdash;"A
ought to be done," "B ought not to be done." Now
the evolutionist, as I conceive, does not proceed to
infer that such judgments are invalid because he
has shown how they originated&mdash;does not conclude
(to use Mr Sidgwick's words) that "<em>all</em> propositions
of the form 'X is right' or 'good,' are untrustworthy;"
but he does ask in what way the history
of these judgments affects their application.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) different
social conditions
from
which they
may have
resulted,</div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) He recognises, in the first place, that all such
judgments are the natural result of a certain social
condition, and that there is, therefore, some probability
that the same kind of social state could
not continue to exist were those moral judgments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>habitually disregarded in conduct. They have resulted
from a certain state of society, and have
been assumed&mdash;after insufficient experience, perhaps&mdash;to
be required for the stability of that state,
so that every action opposed to these moral judgments
will probably tend to weaken social bonds.
But the evolutionist's conclusions are not restricted
to such generalities. He may show that certain
moral judgments or sentiments have had their
origin from the habits of union between individuals,
and of respect for the rights of property, which
have obtained in every relatively permanent society,
and which may therefore be inferred to be probably
necessary for the continued existence of any
community; that certain other sentiments or intuitions
have descended to present individuals from
customs which have not been so universal in the
history of societies, although the communities possessing
them have shown greater power of vitality
than those in which they were absent; while others,
again, may be traced to institutions which, from
their occasional and unprogressive character, may
be shown to be neither necessary nor beneficial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and consequent
difference
in their
value for
conduct;</div>

<p>The evolutionist will therefore contend that
different degrees of value for the regulation of
conduct belong to different moral intuitions or
classes of them. If one class is habitually disregarded,
he may assert that historical evidence
goes to show that society will fall to pieces, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the life of man become, in the expressive words of
Hobbes, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
The disregard of another class will probably lead
to a more precarious existence, or one less filled
with the experiences which make up life; while
opposition to a third class, so far from being hurtful
or dangerous, may remove unnecessary restrictions,
and aid the development both of the individual
and of society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) their
organic
character.</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) There is a second point which will also be
recognised by the evolutionist. Although these
intuitions have been derived, they are now organic,
and their disappearance from the human mind as
instinctive tendencies towards or against action can
only be slow and painful. The process must involve
a certain amount of loss: at the same time, it is
not a process that can be easily avoided. As soon
as the reason of the instinctive tendency is inquired
into, it is weakened as instinct. We pass from the
action itself to the end it is fitted to subserve; and,
if the instinctive action is not the most appropriate,
or has hurtful results, we have already reached the
stage in which the instinct is checked, and begins
to yield to action directed by a principle. Yet it
dies out only gradually, and, so to speak, after a
struggle. Nor does it seem possible to assert with
confidence, as mitigating this struggle, that the
strongest impulses will always be those which are
necessary or advantageous to the existence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
society. For it is a common experience that the
moral intuitions which lead to conduct that has
ceased to serve a purpose, and the internal sanctions
which follow disregard of them, are often even
more powerful than those which protect such virtues
as justice or veracity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resultant
attitude of
evolutionism
to intuitionism.</div>

<p>From the preceding argument it follows that it
cannot be held that moral intuitions are invalid
because evolved. The evolutionist will certainly
go very far wrong, as Mr Sidgwick points out, if he
maintains that a "general demonstration of the
derivedness or developedness of our moral faculty
is an adequate ground for distrusting it." Instead
of holding that, if we succeed in tracing the origin
of an intuition, it is thereby discredited, he will
admit that the mere fact of our possessing any
moral intuition shows that the habits of action
from which it was derived have been permanent
enough to leave their traces on the mental structure,
and that the conduct to which it leads, like
the custom from which it came, will not destroy
society, but, on the contrary, will probably tend to
its permanence. The general attitude of the evolution-theory
to moral intuitions is therefore, after
all, very similar to that which Mr Sidgwick has
reached as a result of his elaborate examination of
the maxims of common-sense. It is an attitude of
trust modified by criticism. In both an appeal
is made from the axioms themselves: in the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
case, to their historical genesis and the facts in
which they originated; in the other, to the searching
test of logical consistency, and their capability
of being applied to conduct. But the theory of
evolution, if it succeeds in tracing the origin of our
moral intuitions, does seem to involve the abandonment
of the old intuitional method which accepted
them as rules of conduct from which no appeal
could be taken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">2. Bearing
of the theory
of evolution
on egoism.</div>

<p>The theory of evolution transforms intuitionism
by the way in which it connects the individual
with the race. Its first effect upon egoism is similar.
The nature of the individual man as now exhibited
is widely different from that which the older individualistic
theory used to deal with. The latter is
typified by the marble statue to which Condillac<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
compares the percipient subject, as yet unaffected
by sense-impressions. The variety of mental life
which is actually met with is accounted for by the
different kinds of experiences different men pass
through; and the consequent difference in the
sources of pleasure and pain accounts for the
diverse lines of activity which human beings follow
out. But the theory of evolution shows that human
nature is infinitely varied, not only through the
variety of circumstances, but through the variety
of inherited dispositions. One individual is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>merely connected with others through considerable
similarity of experience built upon an equally
characterless basis; but he is organically related
to all the members of the race, not only bone of
their bone and flesh of their flesh, but mind of their
mind. He is connected with others by a thousand
subtly interwoven threads of emotion which enter
into his life, and unite his desires and activities
with the functions of the larger organism of which
he is a member.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relation of
egoism to
altruism
as affected
by it:
(<i>a</i>) nature of
the individual
social,</div>

<p>The theory of evolution has thus an important
contribution to make to the question of the relation
between egoism and altruism. It has remained for
it to show historically how the individual is so connected
with the community that the good, or the
pleasure, of the one cannot be considered apart from
that of the other. From the non-evolutionist point
of view it was always open to show how the individual
depended on society, how his wants could
only be supplied by it, and how the security and
happiness of every one were bound up with those
of his fellows. The individualistic theory was thus
able to give all sorts of egoistic reasons why people
should indulge in what is now called altruistic
conduct. Self was seen to be "a poor centre for
a man's actions," and only chosen by the short-sighted
person, who thereby missed both the good
to himself that followed from his neighbours' wellbeing,
and the peculiar pleasure of sympathy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
benevolent action. But the theory of evolution
has shown how the two things have developed
together in the race: first, the actual solidarity between
the individual and the whole; and secondly,
the subjective reflection of the same fact, sympathy
with the feelings of others. When we ask, therefore,
whether it is our own pleasure (or good) or
that of others that we ought to aim at, we are
pointed to the gradual obliteration of the distinction
between the interest and feelings of the individual
and those of the whole. Were this completely
accomplished, there need be no more question
about the matter. If conduct with an egoistic
motive or aim always resulted in altruistic equally
with egoistic effects, and if altruistic conduct had
always egoistic equally with altruistic consequences,
it would even then be little more than vain
subtlety to ask whether egoism or altruism was
to be the real end of conduct. But if, in addition
to the identity of interests, there were also
an identity of motive or feeling,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> the question
would be no longer in place at all. For there
would cease to be either a subjective distinction
in motive between egoism and altruism, or an
objective distinction in the courses of conduct to
which they led. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>but not
completely
social.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
And it is just because this
identification is manifestly incomplete&mdash;because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>neither the interests nor the desires of the individual
harmonise with any degree of exactness
with those of his fellows&mdash;that we must examine
how far the conception of the social organism is
a true expression for the connection of individuals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difference
between the
individual
and social
organisms</div>

<p>At most, the theory of organic evolution can make
out that there is a tendency towards the identification
of the interests of the individual with those
of society. It cannot demonstrate a complete identification.
The community has indeed been called
an organism, and the individual spoken of as a
cell in the tissue of which it is composed; but
we must avoid pressing this analogy to the point
of breaking. Among so many points of similarity
between society and an individual organism, there
is one essential distinction,&mdash;the social organism
has no feelings and thoughts but those of its individual
members&mdash;the conscious centre is in the
unit, not in the whole; whereas, when we regard
the individual organism and its constituent members,
consciousness is seen to exist only in the
whole, not in each several unit. The absence of
a "social sensorium"<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> should, therefore, make us
hesitate to identify the ends of individual with
those of collective action. Every cell in the individual
body has a life-history of its own, besides
partaking of the life of the organism; and, did it
possess the reason which "looks before and after,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>it might probably adopt an egoistic attitude, and
object to the subordination of its private interests
to the good of the whole. In the same way, the
many individual lives which make up the social
organism&mdash;since each of them possesses a separate
consciousness&mdash;are apt to disregard the life of the
larger whole whose members they are. Now what
the theory of utilitarianism requires is, that the
happiness or pleasurable consciousness of the community
or of the race, not that of the individual,
be made the end; and those who make egoism the
end of ethics, commonly maintain that the general
happiness is the end of politics.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The individual
is not indeed required to be entirely unselfish or
"altruistic" in action. He is not altogether forbidden
to seek his own things, nor enjoined to
seek only the things of others; and evolutionist
utilitarianism, indeed, would tell him to seek his
own happiness in the happiness of the community.
But the obvious remark must be borne in mind,
that society, the social organism, cannot experience
happiness. However it may resemble the individual
organism in the manner of its growth, the
modes of its activity, and even its relation to its
component members, yet it cannot feel pleasure or
pain as an individual does. The "happiness of
the community" does not mean the happiness of
the social organism, but is only a concise formula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>for the aggregate happinesses of the individuals
composing it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">in respect
of feeling.</div>

<p>When it is said, therefore&mdash;either as a political
or an ethical theory&mdash;that the happiness of society
is the end for conduct, the end prescribed is altruistic
rather than social. Its object is not an organism,
but an aggregate of individuals. A certain
organisation of society may lead to an increase in
this aggregate happiness, and so be necessary for
the attainment of the end; but if the end is happiness,
the social organism and its wellbeing are
no longer the thing cared for, but the greatest
aggregate of pleasures on the part of its members.</p>

<p>So long, therefore, as the end is pleasure, it must
have reference to individuals. The utilitarian may
try to persuade the agent to seek the pleasures
of others as if they were his own&mdash;requiring him
thus to seek his end out of himself, and the circle
of his own pleasures. And, while we continue to
hold pleasure to be the end, the evolution-theory
can go no further than this. It seemed to have made
out an organic unity between different individuals,
through which it might be possible to effect a
reconciliation between the rival ethical principles of
egoism and altruism. But the feeling of pleasure
is just the point where individualism is strongest,
and in regard to which mankind, instead of being an
organism in which each part but subserves the purposes
of the whole, must rather be regarded as a collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of competing and co-operating units. It is
true that the social factor in the individual life is
brought into scientific cognisance by the theory of
evolution. It shows the way in which his interests
and feelings depend upon others. And if, through
the influence of a political standpoint, or of some
intuition of reason, a universalistic ethics has been
already arrived at, it can bring forward the organic
union of individual and society as a means of enforcing
the social end upon the individual agent.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Theory of
obligation simplified, if universalistic end
arrived at.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In this way the theory of evolution makes a
contribution to ethics at a critical point where
the individualist theory failed. For ethics must
not rest content with pointing out an end for conduct
or standard of morality, without giving a
reason to the individual why he should make this
end his own&mdash;that is, developing a doctrine of obligation.
In many current theories, notably in the
common forms of utilitarianism, the two things are
not necessarily connected, since the standard is
fixed from the point of view of the whole, and obligation
has reference to the individual. The development
of morality may appear to show how the
two standpoints can be connected. If it could be
made out that the happiness of the community and
of the individual are identical, a standard of morality
which made the aggregate happiness the end
might be regarded as carrying its own obligation
within itself: politics and ethics would (on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
hedonistic theory) be harmonised. And, in so far
as evolution has brought the individual and society
into closer reciprocal dependence, it has lessened
the practical difficulty of bringing about this conciliation,
or&mdash;to speak with the utilitarians&mdash;of
making the standard of morality supply a doctrine
of obligation. At present, however, the course of
human development is far from having reached the
point at which actual harmony between the race
and each member of it is established; and it would
therefore still be a subject for inquiry whether the
theory of evolution could provide a basis for moral
obligation, even were the moral standard or the end
for conduct satisfactorily established. But, in determining
this latter question, we find that the above
psychological and sociological investigations have
no longer the same degree of value as before. In
the theory of obligation, every fact brought forward
by evolution to show the harmony of individual
and social welfare makes the way easier
for establishing the reasonableness of the pursuit
of social ends by the individual. But from these
facts of past development we have also to determine
an end for present and future action. And
this question cannot be solved merely by showing
how morality has developed, though that development
may form an important part of the evidence
from which our conclusions are to be drawn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) Limits to

of egoism
and altruism:</div>

<p>The harmony of interests and the harmony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
feelings required for the empirical reconciliation
of egoism and altruism is a condition which needs
only to be stated to show how far it is from being
realised in present circumstances. The constant
struggle involved in the course of evolution throws
doubt even on its ultimate attainment. The rule
has always been that the better-equipped organism
asserts and maintains its supremacy only by vanquishing
the organisms which are not so well
equipped. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(α) continued
existence
of competition;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Conflict and competition have been
constant factors in development. The present circumstances
of the individual have been determined
for him by the war of hostile interests
between different communities, and between different
members of the same community; and his
mental inheritance has been largely formed by the
emotions corresponding to this rivalry. Perhaps
the necessity for conflict has diminished with the
advance of evolution; but it is still sufficiently
great to make competition one of the chief formative
influences in industrial and political life. And
the causes from which the struggle of interests arises
are so constant&mdash;the multiplication of desires and
of desiring individuals keeps so well in advance of
the means of satisfying desires&mdash;that it is doubtful
whether the course of evolution is fitted to bring
about complete harmony between different individuals.
It would almost seem that the "moving
equilibrium" in human conduct, in which there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
no clash of diverse interests, cannot be expected to
be brought about much before the time when the

Man is a member of a family, a tribe, a
nation, the race. His altruism, therefore, may take
the narrow form of family feeling, or it may extend
to tribal feeling, or to patriotism, or even rise to
devotion to humanity. And these do not merely
supplement one another: they are often conflicting
principles of conduct. Action for the sake of the
family may frequently be most unsocial; the keen
patriot ignores the rights of other peoples; the
"citizen of the world" is too often a stranger
to the national spirit. Further, when civilisation
grows complex, the same man is a member of many
intersecting societies&mdash;a church, a trade, a party
organisation<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>&mdash;and has to balance the claims which
each of these has upon him. The sublation of
egoism would still leave to be determined the
different shares which these various social wholes
have in a man's sympathies, and their different
claims upon his conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(γ) the altruism
of interest
and the
altruism of
motive;</div>

<p>Any theory of society will show how the good
of the individual is not merely a part of the good
of the whole, but reacts in various ways upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>organism of which he is a member. But, in the
case of any one individual, the results of acts done
for his own good (or pleasure), and the results
of those done for the good (or pleasure) of the
whole, do not correspond with any exactness, and
often widely diverge. If, then, the individual is
consciously aiming at his own good (or pleasure),
it is&mdash;if we look from the point of view of individualistic
ethics&mdash;only an incidental and fortuitous
result of the action when it promotes the
common good. When we recognise the social factor
in the individual, this judgment must be modified.
The evolution-theory shows how he has become
so constituted that much that pleases him individually,
must of necessity benefit society at large.
But there are obvious limits to the harmony. The
pleasure or interest of the individual is often the
reverse of advantageous to society. It may be
the case that in seeking his own private ends, he
is yet, to use the words of Adam Smith, "led by
an invisible hand to promote an end which was
no part of his intention."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> But, if so, the end
is invisible as well as the hand that points to it.
And the good of society can be said to be the
natural and uniform consequence of the individual's
action, only when he consciously makes it
his end. In a word, the true altruism&mdash;or, as we
might call it, using a word appropriated to another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>purpose&mdash;the true socialism is when the good of
others or of society is pursued for its own sake;
and this is to be distinguished from the false or
imperfect altruism, in which the same outward
result is aimed at, because it is seen to be the
most prudent way of promoting one's own good.
Thus Mr Spencer's elaborate argument<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> to show
that conduct of purely egoistic tendency, equally
with conduct of purely altruistic tendency, is insufficient
and self-destructive, does not reach beyond
the external results of action, and leaves
it possible for both end and motive to be still
egoistic. If "morality is internal,"<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> the discussion
proves no ethical proposition at all. The
egoism of external prudence may indeed be transcended
by recognising that the pleasures and
pains of others are sources of sympathetic feeling
in ourselves. But a subjective or emotional
egoism remains. And if the fact that we "receive
pleasure from the pleasure of another man"<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> is
our reason for seeking his pleasure, we shall cease
to seek it when a means of greater pleasure offers.
In human life as at present constituted, no secure
principle of conduct can be based on the agreement
of individual with social good; for, if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>diverge, as they often do, there is no standard left
for determining their competing claims.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(δ) altruistic
feelings
weak,</div>

<p>It will not do to divide all men, as Mr Stephen
seems to do,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> into two classes, typified by the
reasonable and therefore sympathetic man who
has struck a bargain with society to take "common
stock of pains and pleasures," and the systematically
selfish man who "must be an idiot." For most
men belong to neither of those two classes: their
bargain with society has not been fully completed,
and can be withdrawn from temporarily when
circumstances make withdrawal convenient, though
this process cannot be carried on indefinitely without
greatly weakening the sympathetic feelings.
The majority of men are neither entirely sympathetic
nor yet "systematically selfish": they are
unsystematically sympathetic and unsystematically
selfish. Such men have the sensibilities that give
"leverage" to the moralist.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> But it is futile to
tell them to be more sympathetic, or entirely sympathetic.
For sympathetic feelings cannot be produced
at will: they can only come with that slow
modification of the character brought about by
conduct. Shall we then say that a man should
in all cases of conduct prefer the pleasure of the
whole or of others to his own pleasure? If a man
were to do so, then perhaps, by consistent self-abnegation,
altruism might become pleasant, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>both the man himself and his descendants become
more sympathetically constituted? This perfection
of altruistic sympathies is looked forward to by
Mr Spencer as characteristic of a subsequent&mdash;the
final&mdash;stage of evolution. When that period
comes, men will compete with one another for the
few remaining opportunities of self-sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> At
present, Mr Spencer argues, pure altruism is suicidal.
The individual whose sympathetic nature is undeveloped
may, however, go further, and ask what
right we have to say that "the moral law" is
"conformity to the conditions of social welfare,"<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
rather than to those of individual welfare? Evolution,
it would seem, does not suffice to prove
this proposition, which appears, on the contrary, to
be a survival of the social or political way of looking
at things inherited from the utilitarian theory.
But the point to be proved is why I ought to adopt
this standpoint when considering what the end of
my action is to be. And this point stands in need
of proof here as much as in utilitarianism, and
seems almost equally destitute of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and may be
restrained
by reflection.</div>

<p>Feelings leading to altruistic conduct are undoubtedly
possessed by the average man at his
present stage of development. Yet the being who
is able to reflect on the feelings possessed by him,
and compare the characteristics of different emotional
states, and the activities following from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>them, has already before him the possibility of
transcending them. He is able to estimate their
value in terms of simpler&mdash;or of other&mdash;feelings;
and the man who rigorously does so by the test of
personal pleasure and pain manifests the spirit of
the egoistic hedonist&mdash;a spirit which the theory of
empirical evolution does not seem able to exorcise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) Tendency
of evolution
to supplant
egoism.
Evolution
not the basis
of psychological
hedonism,</div>

<p>At the same time the <i>tendency</i> of the evolution-theory
is not to support but to supplant egoism.
Neither the basis of psychological hedonism on
which egoism is usually made to rest, nor the
independent arguments which have been urged
for its ethical theory, are drawn from the facts of
development. The theory of evolution may, indeed,
be made to suggest that non-hedonistic action
has arisen out of hedonistic: "That all affections
are generated by association with experienced
pleasure&mdash;only that the association is mainly <i>ancestral</i>
in the case of 'affections' proper. The
dim remembrance of ancestral pleasures, the force
of ancestral habit, produces that propension of
which Butler speaks, disproportionate to (distinct)
expectation and (personal) experience of pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
But this view will be rejected by the pure egoist,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
who must maintain that the pain of acting contrary
to ancestral habit would in every case be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>greater than the expected pleasure foregone by
following it. According to the view suggested,
all deliberate volition would still be regarded as
hedonistically determined, though other motives
than pleasure may affect action through having
been inherited from cases of ancestral conduct in
which they tended to personal pleasure. Even
were it shown, however, that altruistic conduct has
been developed out of egoistic, the fact of its development
would not alter its present characteristic.
If action now is not always moved by pleasure
and pain alone, it becomes a question of merely
historical interest to trace its genesis to conduct
to which our ancestors were hedonistically impelled.
The fact remains that the original simplicity
of motive has been broken into, and something
else than personal pleasure admitted to have
sway. But it does not seem to have been made
out that action in the early stages of human life
was completely egoistic, any more than that it is
so now. "From first to last," as Mr Spencer puts
it,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> self-sacrifice seems to have been involved in
the preservation of each successive generation of
individuals. We inherit propensities to action
which have been evolved from an initial stage in
which there was no conscious distinction between
egoism and altruism, though both tendencies were
present and were necessary for the continued existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>of the species. The feelings inherited by the
egoistic hedonist are assessed by him at their pleasure-value.
But such feelings would never have been
acquired by his ancestors, had they tested each germinal
emotion in the same way, and so restrained
self-sacrifice for offspring and fellow-men. Perhaps
they did not clearly see or realise what their pleasure
consisted in, or accurately distinguish it from
family or tribal welfare; but, through this deficiency
of imagination, the feelings were able to
grow and perpetuate themselves, which have tended
to the preservation and consolidation of society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">nor of
ethical
hedonism.</div>

<p>Nor can we gather from evolution any ethical
argument leading to egoism as the principle or end
for conduct; and it is worthy of remark that the
proof attempted by the late Mr Barratt is unaffected
by his recognition of the theory of evolution
as applied to mind, depending on definitions
and axioms which hold (if at all) for the individual
man. Pleasure is defined by him as "that state
of consciousness which follows upon the unimpeded
performance (as such) of its function by one or
more of the parts of our organism;"<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and the
good is forthwith identified with pleasure, by its
being shown that it is a "state of consciousness,"
and that it "results from the due performance of
function (as such)."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> But the "due<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> performance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>of function" is itself a state or states of consciousness;
and in it, not in any sequent or concomitant
circumstances, the good may consist. The good,
we may say, is not pleasure, but the <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ἐνέργεια</span> (~energeia~) of
which pleasure is only the consequent or completion.
This is not a mere question of words. For
"due performance of function" cannot be measured
by the resultant or accompanying feeling of pleasure:
the most perfect functioning, just because it
has become habitual, has often the slightest accompaniment
of pleasant feeling. The way in which
the argument is put in 'Physical Ethics' is thus
well fitted to bring out the fundamental antithesis
between ethical systems according as they place
the good in the active element of function, or in
the passive element of pleasurable feeling which
accompanies functioning. The theory of evolution
seems to have led many of the writers who have
applied it to ethics to the other side of the antithesis
than that adhered to by Mr Barratt. They
recognise ethical value as belonging to "due performance
of function," rather than to the pleased
states of consciousness which follow; and in this
way their theory leads them beyond hedonistic ethics.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Bearing
of the theory
of evolution
on utilitarianism</div>

<p>It has been argued that the theory of evolution
is, in tendency, hostile to the egoistic principle.
Had egoism been consistently recognised and acted
upon during the course of human development, the
features of social life which most promote co-operation
and progress would never have become
persistent. But the same objection cannot be
urged against universalistic hedonism. It is true
that this has not been the end consistently aimed
at in the past. Those from whom our social
instincts are inherited cannot be credited with
having had either the general happiness or social
evolution in view. Society and institutions furthering
the common good were not the work of primitive
utilitarians plotting for the greatest happiness of
the greatest number. They have come down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
us from times when social organisation was forced
upon men by the rude logic of facts which exterminated
tribes in which the bond of union was
weak; and they have been gradually modified by
the pressure of external circumstances and the
growing influence of mental conceptions of what
is best. But the adoption of general happiness as
the end of action would not have had the same
effect on social evolution, as the adoption of personal
happiness as the end would have had. It
would have aided and not have hindered the growth
of the feeling of unity among the members of a
tribe or state, as well as have led to the recognition
of the individual as subordinate to the social
organism. It may thus seem quite natural to look
to utilitarianism as giving the end for reflective
action, and yet to hold along with it what is loosely
called the ethics of evolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">has led to
its modification</div>

<p>But this first attitude of evolution to utilitarianism
was not fitted to be permanent; and the
"start"<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Mr Spencer got on being classed with
anti-utilitarians must have been repeated in the
experience of other moralists as they found themselves
drifting from their ancient moorings. Mr
Spencer's difference from the utilitarians is not
such as to lead him to reject or modify their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>principle. He maintains, as strongly as they do,
that "the ultimately supreme end" is "happiness
special and general."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> But he disagrees with them
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>in method,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
in method, holding that, owing to the incommensurability
of a man's different pleasures and pains,
and to the incommensurability of the pleasures and
pains of one man with those of others, coupled with
the indeterminateness of the means required to
reach so indeterminate an end, happiness is not
fitted to be the immediate aim of conduct.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> But
another method is open to us. For "since evolution
has been, and is still, working towards the
highest life, it follows that conforming to those
principles by which the highest life is achieved, is
furthering that end."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> It is possible "to deduce,
from the laws of life and the conditions of existence,
what kinds of action necessarily tend to produce
happiness, and what kinds to produce unhappiness."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Greatest pleasure, that is to say, is
the end. But it is so impossible to compare different
kinds of pleasure, different people's pleasure,
and different means for obtaining a maximum of it,
that it is not a practical end for aiming at. No
doubt is expressed that greatest happiness is the
ultimate end; although no good reason is given
for holding that it is. But it is an indeterminate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>end, and needs to be interpreted by the course of
evolution which is held to tend to it. It is not
too much to say, therefore, that Mr Spencer is only
nominally a utilitarian. His ethical principles are
not arrived at by an estimate of the consequences
of action, but by deduction from the laws of that
"highest life" which is now in process of evolution.
This alliance between evolutionism and hedonism
will be examined in the following chapter.
At present it is necessary to consider the reasons
which have led other evolutionists to look upon
the new morality as superseding the utilitarian
end.</p>

<p>Mr Spencer's "dissent from the doctrine of
utility, as commonly understood, concerns," he tells
us,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> "not the object to be reached by men, but the
method of reaching it." In other writers, however,
the theory of evolution has not only supplanted
the method of utilitarianism, but also led to a
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>and in
principle.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
modification of its principle. The objections they
have taken to it may perhaps be summed up by
saying that they consider utilitarianism to look
upon conduct from a mechanical, instead of from
an organic point of view. It prescribed conduct
to a man as if he were a machine with a certain
kind and quantity of work to turn out. His nature
was looked upon by it as fixed, and his social conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>as unvarying;
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>a</i>) Ideal of
utilitarianism objected
to as unprogressive.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
and the ideal set before him
was therefore unprogressive&mdash;something that he
was to do or to get, not something that he was
to become. "If consistently applied," it has been
recently argued, "utilitarianism seems irrevocably
committed to a stereotyped and unprogressive
ideal."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> According to Mr Stephen, it "considers
society to be formed of an aggregate of similar
human beings. The character of each molecule
is regarded as constant." It can, therefore, give
a test which is "approximately accurate" only,
which does not allow for the variation of character
and of social relations.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> To the same effect Miss
Simcox maintains that it "might pass muster in
a theory of social statics, but it breaks down altogether
if we seek its help to construct a theory of
social dynamics."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> These writers do not seem to
have made it quite clear, however, in what way
utilitarianism assumes a stationary condition of
human nature, and so formulates conduct in a
way unsuited to a progressive state. To say simply
that the greatest happiness of the greatest number
is the end, is not in itself inconsistent with a progressive
state of human nature. It is true that, in
all the enthusiasm for and belief in progress to be
seen in a writer such as J. S. Mill, there is a constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>goal always set to it in the possible maximum
of pleasant feeling. It would not have been inconsistent
for him, however, to look upon human
nature as capable of developing new susceptibilities
for pleasure. Progress is made by increasing
the amount of pleasure actually got. And so far,
the ideal itself is certainly fixed, while progress
consists in its gradual realisation. But there is
no special virtue in having an ideal which is itself
progressive. A progressive ideal simply means an
ideal which is incompletely comprehended, and the
comprehension of which proceeds gradually with
its realisation. At any time the definition of such
an ideal can only be tentative: with the actual
assimilation of character to it, the intellect comes
to grasp its nature with increasing clearness. I
do not myself think that we can expect to have
more than such a tentative and progressive comprehension
of the moral ideal of humanity. But
we must not take objection to a theory because
it gives at once a clear and definite view of the
final end of conduct: though we must not refrain
from inquiring how the end is known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Force of the
objection
when
attempt
made to
interpret
greatest
happiness,</div>

<p>But the bearing of the objection to utilitarianism
becomes apparent when we try to give some definite
meaning to the end greatest happiness. If we are
content to receive it as simply a very general&mdash;or
rather abstract&mdash;expression for our ideal, nothing
need be said, except to put the question, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
been already asked, How we came by such an ideal?
The difficulty arises when we attempt to apply the
ideal to practice. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>by showing
the way in
which men
can obtain
happiness,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
With men of fixed character in
an unchanging society, our way might be comparatively
clear. But, when both character and social
relations vary, and their variation extends to susceptibility
to pleasure and pain, and depends on the
actions adopted to obtain the end, utilitarianism
may well appear to be without a principle by which
to determine between different kinds of conduct.
To an objection similar to this, but taken from the
old point of view, that we have no time before acting
to sum up the pleasurable and painful consequences
of our actions, Mill replied that there had been
"ample time&mdash;namely, the whole past duration of
the human species"<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>&mdash;in which to estimate the felicific
results of conduct. The variability of faculty
and function makes this answer lack convincing
power. Yet, perhaps, we are apt at present to disregard
the real value of this collective experience of
the race. True, human nature is not a constant;
yet certain of its qualities are persistent and constant
enough not to leave us in doubt as to whether,
say, murder and theft are beneficial or injurious
to happiness. There are at least certain actions,
and, still more, certain abstentions, upon which
human security&mdash;the basis of happiness&mdash;depends.
But it would seem that those "secondary laws"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>may be more properly regarded as conditions of life
than means to pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and a maximum
of it.</div>

<p>The difficulty, however, comes most clearly to
the front when we attempt to define the maximum,
and that not for an individual or generation
only, but for the race. It is not happiness
merely, but greatest happiness, that is the utilitarian
end. Is there any way, then, of determining
how the maximum of happiness is to be
obtained for generations whose characters, though
inherited from present individuals, may be modified
almost indefinitely? The very existence and numbers
of these future generations are problematic; and
Mill, as is well known, spent much of his energy
in trying to convince the present generation to restrict
the numbers of the next. Even on the fundamental
question as to whether happiness is to be
obtained by the restriction of desires or by the satisfaction
which leads to their recurrence and increase,
no principle can be extracted from utilitarian ethics.
The theory of evolution has shown how desires may
be uprooted in the character of the race, though
they remain to the end in the present individuals;
but in each case utilitarianism would require us to
sum up and estimate the relative advantages of renunciation
and satisfaction,&mdash;a problem which the
modifiability of human character seems to make
impracticable. Thus, even if certain rules of living
may be ascertained, and justified by the utilitarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
principle, it would seem that the end of greatest
happiness for the race of man, or the sentient creation
generally, must remain "abstract." There
seems no principle through which it may be applied
to conduct&mdash;no hope of an accurate estimate
of results&mdash;when the variability of the
individual and of social relations is taken into
account.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(b) Objection
to utilitarianism
as a
theory of
consequences;</div>

<p>Connected with this is the assertion that morality
must have an inward, not an external standard.
The evolutionists are inclined to condemn utilitarianism
as a theory of consequences, dealing solely
with work produced. According to Mill, "utilitarian
moralists have gone beyond almost all others
in affirming that the motive has nothing to do with
the morality of the action, though much with the
worth of the agent."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> And this seems to be just
what evolutionism objects to. Even the worth of
the agent is, according to utilitarianism, only a
tendency to perform the actions called moral: "a
good or a bad disposition" is said to be "a bent
of character from which useful or from which hurtful
actions are likely to arise."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Against this view
Mr Stephen maintains that "the attempt to secure
an absolute and immutable moral law in its external
shape must be illusory. The moral law can be
stated unconditionally when it is stated in the form
'Be this,' but not when it is stated in the form 'Do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>this.'"<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> This, however, appears to express the matter
in a way not free from difficulty. The organic view
of conduct will object not only to considering action
apart from character, but also to considering character
apart from action. We must treat conduct as
a whole: and, in order to do so, we must treat it as
both arising out of and forming character; and we
must treat character not as mere potentiality, but
as it realises itself in conduct. The weakness of
the utilitarian theory is its method of treating
actions merely in respect of their results: the evolutionist
must show how results are connected with
motives,&mdash;how character and conduct are different
aspects of a whole.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(c) and as related
solely
to sensibility,</div>

<p>The difference of the evolutionist view from utilitarianism
comes out at another point. The latter
places the standard and test of conduct in its effects
on the sensibility. The best is that which brings
most pleasure. Utilitarians are now, for the most
part, ready to admit that, to be in earnest with their
theory, they must reject Mill's attempt to distinguish
qualities among pleasures. "If morality is to
be defined by happiness, we must, of course, allow
all kinds of happiness to count, and to count equally
so far as they are actually equal. We must reckon
the pleasures of malevolence as well as those of
benevolence."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Of his own pleasures&mdash;of the relative
amounts of pleasure he gets from various sources&mdash;each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>man is the final judge. One man prefers
"push-pin" to poetry, another poetry to "push-pin";
and neither has a right to call the other mistaken.
If we are to aim at the greatest maximum
pleasure, therefore, we must not strive for what
are commonly called "high" pleasures rather than
"low" pleasures, except as greater in intensity. If
we must have a standard, the judgment of the <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">φρόνιμος</span> (~phronimos~)
for which Mill contended must be superseded
by the judgment of the average man. If pleasure
is the only end, and satisfaction is simply another
name for it, then it is plainly incorrect to say that
"it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than
a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied
than a fool satisfied."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>of which
there is no common
measure.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
As has been urged from
the evolutionist point of view, "there is no common
measure of happiness to enable us to say that the
more perfect being enjoys more of it than the less."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
There seems one way only in which utilitarianism
can bring its moral ideal into harmony with the
upward tendency claimed for itself by evolutionist
ethics&mdash;and that is, by maintaining that the
pleasures incident to what are regarded as the
higher functions are the pleasures which excel
others in respect of "fecundity": they are the
source of future pleasures, and are frequently inexclusive
even in their present enjoyment. The difficulty
in making this assertion is just that these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>"higher" pleasures are but slightly appreciated by
the majority of men, and can hardly be said to be
pleasures for them at all. But here the theory of
evolution, whose adherents have been acting the
part of the candid friend to utilitarianism, must
come to its aid, and admit that human nature may
be so modified in the future as to allow of the "highest"
becoming also the "greatest" of pleasures. The
argument in the mouth of the utilitarian is perhaps
a somewhat arbitrary one, since it could be applied
equally well to any class of pleasures. The notion
of "higher," as applied either to conduct or to pleasure,
has been accepted from current moral opinion.
But the theory of evolution has set itself to explain
this notion, and to develop a theory of morality in
harmony with its own scientific positions, and free
from the defects which it has found in other systems.
How far it contributes to the determination
of the ethical end will form the subject of investigation
in the following chapters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>HEDONISM AND EVOLUTIONISM.</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">1. Alliance
of evolutionism
and
hedonism
effected in
two ways:</div>

<p>The alliance between Evolutionism and Hedonism
may be arrived at from either of the two points of
view which are being brought into connection: may
be either an attempt to bring the hedonistic end into
the definite region of law revealed by the evolution
of life; or may result from the endeavour to give
clearness and persuasiveness to an ethical end which
evolution itself seems to point to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) greatest
happiness to
be obtained
by conforming
to laws
of life or of
evolution;</div>

<p>The former point of view is represented in Mr
Spencer's rejection of empirical utilitarianism, and
substitution for it of a practical end which is not
enunciated in terms of pleasure. Happiness is still
regarded by him as the supreme end; but the tendency
to it is not to be adopted as the end in practical
morality. There are certain conditions to social
equilibrium which "must be fulfilled before complete
life&mdash;that is, greatest happiness&mdash;can be obtained in
any society."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Thus the form of "rational utilitarianism"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>which he endeavours to establish "does not
take welfare for its immediate object of pursuit,"
but "conformity to certain principles which, in the
nature of things, causally determine welfare."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Having
deduced "from the laws of life and the conditions
of existence what kinds of action necessarily tend
to produce happiness, and what kinds to produce
unhappiness," we are to recognise these deductions
"as laws of conduct ... irrespective of a direct
estimation of happiness or misery."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The assumption
is thus distinctly made that the tendency of
life is to happiness, and that the laws of its evolution
yield practical principles by following out which
the greatest happiness may be obtained, without
attempting the impossible task of estimating directly
the felicific and infelicific results of conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) ethical
end of
evolution
interpreted
by pleasure.</div>

<p>Starting with the evolutionist point of view, but
with an opposite estimate of the relative value for
practice of the ends supplied by evolutionism and
by hedonism, a like identification of them might
seem advisable. The "increase of life" to which
evolution tends may be regarded as not merely an
account of the actual process of existence, but as a
principle of action for a conscious being. In this
way some such ethical imperative as "Be a self-conscious
agent in the evolution of the universe"<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
may be formulated. Yet as the "evolution of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>universe" is a somewhat large conception, and its
laws are not clear to every one, it may seem necessary
that the end should be explained by translation
into better-known terms. And this may be done if
the conduct which promotes life most is, at the same
time, the conduct which increases pleasure most. In
this way, although the ultimate end is life, or, in
vaster phrase, "the evolution of the universe," the
practical end is pleasure. The moral value of conduct
will depend on its tendency to increase the
balance of pleasure over pain. The ethics of evolution
will be reduced to hedonism.</p>

<p>This way of determining the evolutionist end is
put forward as a logical possibility rather than as
representing the views of any party. The contribution
which the theory of evolution has to offer
towards the determination of the ethical end, has
not yet received that definite expression which
would justify our passing by any logical interpretation
of it, on the ground of its not being actually
adopted by ethical writers. Yet it would seem that
the above point of view is not altogether foreign to
evolutionist morality. The preservation or development
of the individual&mdash;or of the race&mdash;which is
put forward as an expression both for the actual
course of evolution and the subjective impulse corresponding
to it, is often assumed to agree at each
step with the desire for pleasure, and, when the
stage of reflective consciousness is reached, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
identical with the pursuit of a maximum of pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
In this way it is assumed that the preservation and
development of life tend always to pleasure, and
that the end or tendency of evolution is being fulfilled
when the greatest pleasure is wisely sought.
It is therefore necessary to inquire how far the
correspondence between life and pleasure, or between
development and pleasure, actually holds, that we
may see whether it is possible for the one to take
the place of the other in determining the end for
conduct.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">2. Evolutionist
argument
for
concomitance
of life
and pleasure.</div>

<p>Now it is argued, from the point of view of
evolution, that, taking for granted that pleasure
motives action, the organisms in which pleasurable
acts coincided with life-preserving or health-promoting
acts must have survived in the struggle for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>existence at the expense of those organisms whose
pleasurable activity tended to their destruction or
to the hindrance of their efficiency.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The assumption
in this argument, in addition to the constant
postulate of natural selection, is simply that pleasure
is a chief motive of action; the conclusion to
which it leads is, that there is a broad correspondence
between life-preserving and pleasurable acts&mdash;that
the preservation and development of life are
pleasurable. It is necessary to examine with care
the validity of this important argument with reference
to the attacks that may be made on it from
the pessimist point of view; and, if its doctrine
of the correspondence of life and pleasure is not
entirely erroneous, to inquire further whether this
correspondence can be made to establish an end for
conduct, in accordance with the theory of evolution,
by measuring life in terms of pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Objections
to this
argument:</div>

<p>What then is to be said of the supposed "conflict
between Eudæmonism [Hedonism] and Evolutionism"
which v. Hartmann<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> opposes to the optimist
doctrine that evolution has tended to make life and
pleasure coincide?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>The problem of Pessimism resolves itself into
two questions which admit of being kept distinct:
(<i>a</i>) The first is, Does life on the whole give, or can
it give, a balance of pleasure? This is the fundamental
question of the value of life as put by those,
whether optimists or pessimists, who assume that
"value" means "pleasure-value." If it be answered
in the negative, the hedonistic ideal must be the reduction
of the adverse balance to the zero-point of
feeling striven after by Eastern ascetics, but, to all
appearance, obtained only and most easily by death.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
(<i>b</i>) The second question is, Does the evolution of life
lead to an increase of pleasure and diminution of
pain? This is the question brought into prominence
in recent discussions, and of most importance
for the present inquiry; and upon an affirmative
answer to it Evolutionist Hedonism is plainly dependent.
To both questions v. Hartmann gives an
answer in the negative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) that life
cannot bring
more pleasure
than
pain;</div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If the pessimist view of life is correct, Mr
Spencer holds,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> then "the ending of an undesirable
existence being the thing to be wished, that which
causes the ending of it must be applauded." And
this is so far true, though not necessarily true in
the way Mr Spencer thinks. For this undesirable
existence cannot, perhaps, be brought to a final conclusion
merely by ending the individual life: this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>would only leave room for other individuals to fill
the vacant places. Annihilation is the end not
directly for the individual, but for the race. Not
life itself, according to Schopenhauer, but the will
to live, is to be killed in the individual man. Even
this code of morals, Hartmann thinks, is a remnant
of the false, pre-evolutionist individualism, and
would hinder the course of the universe, by leaving
the game to be played out by the remaining individuals
whose wills were not strong enough to curb
or kill themselves. It is a mistake to think that
the will to live which pulses through all existence
can be annihilated by the phenomenal individual.
The individual's duty is not to seek for himself the
painlessness of annihilation or passionless Nirwâna,
but to join in the ceaseless painful striving of
nature, and, by contributing to the development of
life, to hasten its arrival once more at the goal of
unconsciousness. The self-destruction, not of the
individual will, but of the cosmic or universal will,
is the final end of action.</p>

<p>Apart from the metaphysical view of things with
which this estimate of the value of life is connected,
and which may be regarded perhaps as its consequent
rather than its cause,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> the pessimist doctrine
has a double foundation, in psychology and in the
facts of life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">(α) from the
negative
nature of
pleasure,</div>

<p>Psychologically, it seems to be best supported
by Schopenhauer's doctrine of will or desire as an
incessant painful striving, pleasure being merely
the negative of this pain, and always coming short
of completely satisfying it. But this position involves
a double error in psychological analysis, and
is relinquished even by Hartmann, though he still
regards pleasure as in all cases satisfaction of desire.
Desire is itself merely a secondary or derived fact
in human nature, consequent on the inhibition of
volitional energy.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The pleasures we call passive
are independent of it; and those which attend upon
activity, but are not themselves part of the end of
action, are also enjoyed without being striven after
in order to satisfy a want. Further, it is a mistake
to look upon the pleasure of attainment as a mere
negation of the pain of desire. The painful element
in desire comes from the inhibition of the attempted
realisation of an ideal object. In unsatisfied desires,
it is true, the pain is in proportion to the
strength of the restrained longing. But, if the
inhibition is overcome, the pain is not equal to the
strength of the desire, but only to the amount of
opposition that has to be conquered in satisfying
it. Hence, not only are there other pleasures than
those of satisfied desire, but even the pleasure got
from such satisfaction is something more than a mere
recompense for the pain accompanying the desire.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">(β) from the
facts of human
life;</div>

<p>The support got by pessimism from the facts of
human life is more difficult to estimate at its true
value. It is obvious that pleasure and pain are
intermingled in almost every experience; and the
proportion in which they are mixed varies greatly
in different circumstances and according to the
susceptibilities of different persons. If we ask a
number of people whether life is on the whole
pleasant to them, not only do we receive a variety
of answers which it is hard to sum up and average,
but the answers we get are apt to reflect the feeling
of the moment rather than to represent an impartial
estimate of the pleasure and pain of a lifetime.
Thus experience seems unable to give us a trustworthy
answer as to the average pleasure-value of
life; but, if its verdict is correct, that to some life
is pleasant, though to many painful, this shows
that a surplus of pain does not follow from the
nature of life, and thus destroys the position of
thoroughgoing pessimism, which looks upon this as
the worst of all possible worlds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) that the
evolution of
life does not
tend to
pleasure.</div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It may still be maintained, however&mdash;and
this is the position which chiefly concerns us here&mdash;that
the course of evolution does not tend to increase
the pleasure in life at the expense of the pain
in it, and that, therefore, even although pleasure and
evolution may both of them be possible ends of conduct,
they are ends which point in different directions
and lead to different courses of action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">(α) Incompleteness
of
the evolutionist
argument.</div>

<p>It is necessary for the evolutionist who holds
that the development of life does not tend to
increased pleasure, to meet the argument already
adduced<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> to show their correspondence. Nor does
that argument seem to be altogether beyond criticism.
To compare progress or development with
pleasure, we ought to know exactly what is meant
by both terms. Yet it is impossible to have a clear
notion of progress without an idea of the end to
which it tends, and this has not yet been obtained.
It is largely on account of the difficulty of obtaining
such an idea that some evolutionists seem
to have been driven to measure progress in terms
of pleasure, just as, owing to the difficulty of estimating
and summing up pleasures, some hedonists
have been induced to measure them by the progress
of evolution. What we have now to see is whether
the correspondence assumed between progress and
pleasure actually exists. And, to avoid the tautology
of saying that progress is increase of life, we
must judge of it simply by empirical observation of
the nature of human activity and of the course of
human affairs.</p>

<p>Now the attempted identification of pleasurable
and life-promoting activities rests on an incomplete
account of the motives and results of action. For,
in the first place, even admitting that pleasure and
avoidance of pain are the only motives to action,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>the influence of natural selection has not prevented
actions hurtful to life being sometimes accompanied
by pleasant sensations. Its tendency to do
so has been much more effective in the lower
orders of animal life than in the higher. The
latter, especially man, possess the power of representing
ideal states in the imagination, and are
thus able to avoid actions hurtful to life, although
these actions are pleasant at the time. For the
hurtful consequences of the action may be so
vividly represented in idea as to outweigh the influence
of the present pleasure which could be got
from its enjoyment.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>And further, the analysis of volition involved in
the argument seems to be insufficient. For there
are other springs of action to be taken account
of than pleasure and its opposite. Habit, imitation,
and interests of a more comprehensive kind
than desire of pleasant feeling, are all motives to
action. It is true that pleasure is always felt in
the successful performance of an action, and it is
also true that the inhibition of will is always
painful; but it is none the less incorrect to look
either upon the pleasure that follows from the
action, or the pain that would be the result of its
inhibition as, in ordinary cases, the motive. It is
motives of a different kind than pleasure, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>imitation<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and the influence of ideal ends, which
most often lead to progress. And the progress
that is due to such motives cannot be measured
by its effect in increasing pleasure, nor assumed to
make pleasure and life correspond. Other activities
less advantageous in nature in all respects
but this, might, so far as the reasoning goes, lead
to equal or to more pleasurable consequences. At
the best, therefore, the above argument only proves
a general tendency towards the coincidence of
pleasurable actions with actions which promote
life; it does not show that the increase of life
can be accurately measured by pleasure. The process
of natural selection might kill off all organisms
whose desires led them normally to action hurtful
to life. But sufficient evidence has not been
brought forward to show that it is fitted to produce
an exact proportion between progress and
pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(β) The pessimist
doctrine
that
life tends to
misery:</div>

<p>Hartmann, however, attempts to strike a more
fundamental blow than this at the presupposition
involved in the argument for evolutionist hedonism.
For he contends that, throughout all life, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
great pulse of progress is neither, <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>aa</i>) the hypothesis
of
the unconscious;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
on the one hand,
desire for pleasure, nor, on the other, the more
complex and varied motives just referred to, but
that it is the incessant striving towards fulness of
life by a universal unconscious will, which is manifested
in all things, and which is for ever pressing
onwards towards conscious realisation, regardless
of the increase of pain which the course of evolution
implies. But this hypothesis of unconscious
will is not a justifiable metaphysical principle got
at by the analysis of experience, and necessary for
its explanation, though lying beyond it. It is a
"metempirical," or rather mythical, cause interpolated
into the processes of experience. Hence
the antagonism in which it stands to psychological
fact: its disregard of the effect of pleasure as a
powerful motive in volition; and its neglect of the
obvious truth that function so reacts upon organ
that all actions have simply by continuance a
tendency to be performed with greater ease, and
therefore to yield in their performance increase
of pleasure. The smoothness and precision with
which it works may, indeed, lead to a function
being performed unconsciously, and thus without
either pain or pleasure. But the normal exercise
of conscious activity is uniformly pleasurable.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>While giving up Schopenhauer's doctrine of the
merely negative character of pleasure, Hartmann
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
yet contends that "eternal limits" <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>bb</i>) the nature
of volition;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
are set by the
very nature of volition, which make it impossible
to have a world with more pleasure in it than
pain. But his arguments<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> come very far short
of proving his case. For, in the first place, to say
that the stimulation and wearying of the nerves
imply the necessity of a cessation of pleasure as
well as of pain, is to confuse complete states of
consciousness with the subjective feeling which
accompanies each state. It is not true that one
ever becomes weary of pleasure: to talk as if there
were one class of nerves for pleasure, and another
for pain, is absurd. But every mental state, however
pleasurable to start with, tends to become
monotonous, wearisome, or painful. Pleasure thus
requires a change from one mental state to another:
to say that it requires a change from pleasure to
something else is a contradiction in terms. It is
the objects or activity that require to be varied,
not the feeling of pleasure. Again, in the second
place, it is true that pleasure is to be regarded as
indirect <i>in so far as</i> it is entirely due to the
cessation of a pain, and not to instantaneous satisfaction
of will. But it does not do to regard the
pleasure as altogether indirect when, although the
cessation of a pain is necessary for its production,
it is itself something more than this cessation.
The inhibition of will often prevents the realisation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>of an object which is very much more than a
recompense in pleasurable quality for the pain of
the restraint; and although the pleasure only arises
from the removal of this painful state of inhibition,
there is a direct and positive gain over and
above the gratification of having pain removed.
In the third place, Hartmann argues that the
satisfaction of will is often unconscious, whereas
pain is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo ipso</i> conscious. But, even admitting the
reality of unconscious will or desire, which this
argument involves, it does not follow that pleasure
and pain are differently affected in regard to
it. If pain is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo ipso</i> conscious, so also is pleasure;
if the satisfaction of unconscious desire gives no
pleasure, neither does the absence of such satisfaction
give pain.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> It is true, as Hartmann adds
in the fourth place, that desire is often long and
the joy of satisfaction fleeting; but this refers not
so much to mental pleasures as to those connected
with physical appetite. Of them it is true that</p>

<span class="iq">"These violent delights have violent ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in their triumph die."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But in the higher pleasures with more permanent
objects of pursuit, although the desire may be long-continued,
the pleasure does not disappear in the
moment of gratification.</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, that the pessimist psychology,
in treating pleasure in a different way from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>pain, mistakes the true nature of both as simply
"polar extremes"<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> of feeling, and prevents the
argument being faced which has been brought
forward to show the increasing correspondence
of pleasure and life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">(<i>cc</i>) the facts
of human
progress:</div>

<p>The failure of the psychological argument makes
the whole burden of the proof of pessimism rest
upon the argument from historical facts. And the
attempt has been definitely made to show, from
observation of the course of human affairs, that
the progress of the world tends to misery. It
is necessary, therefore, to ask whether it can be
established that the facts included under the vague
term "human progress" have a normal tendency
either to increase pleasure or to act in the opposite
way. Now progress is a characteristic both of the
individual and of society; but pleasure only belongs
to the former, so that an answer to the
question whether individual progress tends to increase
the surplus of pleasure over pain, still leaves
unsettled the question as to the effect of social
progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">individual
progress;</div>

<p>It seems evident that both the physical and
mental development of the individual imply greater
adaptability to, and correspondence with, the external
world, and that, on account of this development,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>there is less unpleasant friction between
outer and inner relations, and means are at hand
for obtaining objects of desire with less exertion
than formerly. But, at the same time, the increase
of knowledge and of skill always implies not merely
the means of satisfying old wants, but the creation
of new ones: we see more of the evil in the world
than our forefathers did, and there are more avenues
by which it can approach us, if we have also more
effective means for avoiding what we dislike. And,
although knowledge brings with it not only the
pleasure of gratified curiosity, but that recognition
of a universal order which frees the mind from the
evils bred by a belief in the fickleness of nature,
yet this all-pervading sense of law has so regulated
our beliefs and methods of research that science
itself may seem to have lost the peculiar freshness
of interest that belonged to its earlier stages; while
the feelings called forth by a vision of the divine
presence in the world, find but a poor substitute in
the sublime region of "cosmic emotion." Further,
the widening of the sympathetic feelings and their
consequent activities, and the refinement of the
whole sensitive nature by which it responds more
quickly and accurately to emotional stimuli, have
made the present generation more susceptible to
both pain and pleasure than its predecessors. But
Hartmann's argument that the duller nervous system
of the savage races (Naturvölker) makes them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
happier than the civilised (Culturvölker),<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> leaves out
of sight the new sources of pleasure as well as pain
that are opened up to a refined sensibility. According
to Hartmann, the æsthetic sensibilities may be
a source of painless pleasure: yet even their cultivation
cannot be said to be matter of pure gain
to their possessors; for the pain of discord is to
be set against&mdash;in his opinion, it outweighs&mdash;the
pleasure of harmony. On the whole, then, it would
appear that the evolution of the individual leads to
greater possibilities both of pleasure and of pain.
The refinement of the intellectual and emotional
nature opens up wider ranges of both kinds of
feeling; and we are driven to look mainly to the
improvement of the social environment for the
means of increasing pleasure and diminishing
pain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">social progress:</div>

<p>But to estimate the hedonistic value of social
progress is a still more difficult task than the preceding.
For the march of affairs has often little
regard to its effect on the happiness of the greater
number of people concerned. Industrially, <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>industrial,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
it may
be thought that the increase in the amount of
wealth produced affords a vastly greater means of
comfort and luxury. Yet, it is doubtful whether
this increase has always been sufficient to keep
pace with the growth of population; and it is certain
that every society whose territory is limited,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>must, when its numbers have increased beyond
a certain point, begin to experience the diminishing
returns which nature yields for the labour expended
upon it. Indeed, the tendency to an excess in the
rate of increase of population over that of means of
subsistence is one of the chief causes which make
it so difficult to assert that civilisation tends to
greater happiness. But, even although the average
quantity of wealth be greater now than before, it
must be remembered that wealth is measured by
its amount, whereas happiness depends on the
equality with which that amount is distributed.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
Yet the present industrial <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> tends to the
accumulation of immense wealth in a few hands,
rather than to its proportionate increase throughout
the community. The industrial progress which
increases the wealth of the rich, has little to recommend
it if it leaves the "labouring poor" at a
starvation-wage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>if the population can be divided into plutocrats
and proletariate? Moreover, the very nature of
economic production seems to imply an opposition
between social progress and individual wellbeing.
For the former, in demanding the greatest possible
amount of produce, requires an excessive and
increasing specialisation of labour. Each worker
must perform that operation only to which he has
been specially trained, or which he can do best.
And in this way industrialism tends to occupy the
greater part of the waking hours of an increasing
proportion of human lives in the repetition of a
short series of mechanical movements which call
out a bare minimum of the faculties of the worker,
dwarf his nature, and reduce his life to a mere
succession of the same monotonous sensation.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> In
spite, therefore, of immense improvements in the
general conditions of wellbeing, it is still difficult
to say that the happiness of the average human life
has been much increased by the march of industrial
progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and political.</div>

<p>A more hopeful view may, perhaps, be taken of
the effect of political progress. The increase of
popular government gratifies the desire for power,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>and, in some cases, even tends to a more efficient
management of affairs. Still more important in its
effect on happiness is the greater security for life
and property which the gradual consolidation of
political control has brought about. It would seem,
too, that the harsher features of the struggle by
which this advance takes place have been modified;
and that the war of politics has abated in fury more
than the war of trade. On the whole, therefore,
the tendency of modern political rule appears to
be towards an almost unmixed gain in respect of
happiness,&mdash;by the security it affords for life and
property, by its wide distribution of political power,
and by the room it gives for individual freedom.
Yet the last of these results&mdash;in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</i>
system of industrialism to which it has led, and
which, in spite of many modifications, is still in the
ascendant&mdash;has effects of a more doubtful character.</p>

<p>This mere reference to one or two of the leading
features of progress would not be sufficient to support
a thesis either as to its beneficial or baneful
tendency. But evidence enough has been led to
show that the effects on pleasure of individual and
social development are of a mixed kind,&mdash;that
culture and civilisation have neither the tendency
to misery which Hartmann follows Rousseau in
attributing to them,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> nor, on the other hand, that
steady correspondence with increasing pleasure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>which would be required to establish the position
of evolutionist hedonism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of
choosing
between
evolutionism
and
hedonism.</div>

<p>It follows, therefore, that, without adopting a
pessimist view, we must still make our choice
between evolutionism and hedonism. The course
of evolution&mdash;so far as experience helps us to
understand it&mdash;cannot be measured by increase of
pleasure. Nothing is said here to show that it
is not perfectly consistent to hold that the moral
feelings and ideas, the customs to which they have
given rise, and the institutions in which they are
embodied, have been produced by the ordinary laws
of evolution, and yet to maintain that the moral end
for reflective beings is the hedonistic or utilitarian
end. It may be possible, that is to say, to be an
evolutionist in psychology and sociology, at the
same time that one is a hedonist in ethics. But it
is not allowable to adopt pleasure as the end, and
yet speak of it as determined by evolution. Evolution
can determine no such end until it be shown
that the progress it connotes implies a proportionate
increase of pleasure.</p>

<p>Such is the conclusion to which we are led by a
consideration of the bearings of evolution upon the
increase of pleasure and pain. But this argument
requires to be supplemented by the more satisfactory
method of an independent analysis of pleasure
in relation to the development of human nature;
and from this analysis we may hope to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
how far the theory of evolution is consistent with
the ethics of hedonism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">4. The psychological
analysis of
pleasure and
pain in relation
to the
ethics of
evolution.</div>

<p>The relative and transient nature of pleasure has
been urged as an objection against any form of
hedonism by many philosophers since the time of
Plato. And the argument has of late years been
brought forward in a way which shows that the
calculus of "pleasures" and "pains" which Bentham's
ethics implies is much less certain and easy
than its author supposed. This has been made
clear both by the subtle analysis carried out by the
late Professor Green, and by Professor Sidgwick's
examination of the difficulties which beset the
"hedonistic calculus." It does not appear, however,
to have been made out that the nature of
pleasure proves hedonism to be impossible as the
end of conduct. But it may, perhaps, appear that
the case is altered when we consider the matter in
the light of the evolutionist form of hedonism now
under examination, and estimate from this point
of view the ethical bearings of the psychological
analysis of feeling.</p>

<p>The difficulty of defining pleasure or pain is not
the same as the difficulty or impossibility of defining
any elementary sensation. For the latter is connected
in definite ways with other similar sensations,
can be compared and associated with them, and by
such association go to make up an object or thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>a</i>) The purely
subjective
nature of
pleasure;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But pleasure and pain are neither objects nor parts
of objects: they cannot be distinguished from or
associated with the impressions of the senses so as
to constitute an object. They can only be spoken
of as an affection of the percipient and active subject,
different in kind both from the objects it knows
and the acts it performs: each can only be defined
as the opposite of the other. Pleasure and pain
are not real phenomena with a distinguishable
existence of their own, like sensations, conceptions,
or actions; they have no trace of objectivity whatever,
but are, as Hamilton puts it,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> "subjectively
subjective": "pleasure is not a fact, nor is pain a
fact, but one fact is pleasurable, another painful."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>its connection
with
objective
states of
mind,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Pleasure, therefore, is a mere feeling of the subject,
concomitant with the sensory or motor presentations
which, by reason of their presence to consciousness,
we call objects or actions. It is not something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>by itself which we can choose rather than something
else, as we may select a peach instead of an apple.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>through
which it
may be made
the end of
conduct.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
It can only be made the end of conduct in an
indirect way. We must aim not at pleasure <i>per se</i>,
but at objects which we have reason to believe will
be accompanied by pleasurable feeling. Pleasure
and pain, as it has been urged,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> are not quantities
that can be added and subtracted. It is not the
pleasurable or painful feeling, but the perceptional
or cognitive elements in the mental state of which
it is an element, that admit of plurality and
measurement. But we may foresee that one mental
state will be accompanied by pleasurable, another
by painful feeling, and, on that account, we may
choose the former. In a great number of cases we
are further able to make a quantitative estimate,
and to say that the pleasurable feeling accompanying
one object or action is more intense than that
accompanying another, and thus to choose one object
rather than another, not merely because one
is pleasurable while the other is painful, but (in
cases where both are pleasurable) because it is supposed
that the one will yield more intense or more
prolonged pleasure than the other. If this be true,
the purely subjective nature of pleasure does not
make it impossible for it to be taken as the practical
end of conduct for the individual&mdash;however
inexact and tentative many of its estimates must be&mdash;though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>it will shortly appear that its nature unfits
it to be the end on the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>The difficulty arises when we attempt to interpret,
by means of pleasure, the increase and development
of life to which the course of evolution
tends, and which is sometimes put forward as the
end which the evolution-theory prescribes for conduct.
And the difficulty also meets us when we
seek to explain the conception of a maximum of
pleasures as the end, by means of the conception
of evolution.</p>

<p>As long as we are content to look upon human
nature as consisting of constant sources of activity
and enjoyment, and having fixed susceptibilities for
pleasure and pain, it is easy to adopt the increase
of pleasure and diminution of pain as our aim.
But the case is altered when we take into consideration
the fact that man's actions and sensibilities
are subject to indefinite modification. Pleasure, as
we have seen, is a feeling of the subject dependent
upon the objects, sensory and motor, present at any
time to consciousness. These objects alone can be
our end; but we may aim at certain of them rather
than others, simply on account of their pleasurable
accompaniment. It may happen, however, that an
object or action at one time pleasurable becomes
painful at another time, and that what is now painful
ceases to be so and becomes pleasurable. In
this case our course of action, if motived by pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
would have to be entirely changed, our practical
ethics revised and reversed. And, although no
sudden alteration such as this ever takes place, the
theory of evolution shows that a gradual modification
of the kind is going on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) The conditions
of
pleasure and
pain:</div>

<p>The conditions of pleasure and pain, physiological
and psychological, are matter of dispute; and
the dispute is complicated by the confusion of the
physiological with the psychological problem. It
will be evident, however,&mdash;if only we keep different
things clear of each other,&mdash;that both kinds of
explanation are possible, and that they are distinct
from one another. The question of the nervous
antecedents and concomitants of feeling is one
thing, and quite distinct from the question which
now arises of the mental antecedents or concomitants
of feeling. And here the theories which
have attempted a generalisation of the phenomena
are, in the light of recent inquiry, mainly two:
the theory that pleasure follows, or is the sense of,
increase of life, and that which holds it to be the
concomitant of unimpeded conscious functioning or
of medium activities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(α) Pleasure
not definable
as the
sense of
increased
vitality;</div>

<p>The former theory<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> might be put forward as indicating
how it is possible to institute a connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>between pleasure and evolution. But it has been
already shown that neither the actual facts of life,
nor the tendencies to action, can be so interpreted
as to make their nature and development correspond,
with any degree of exactness, with pleasure
and its increase.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Nor is it possible to make out
that every pain corresponds to a loss of vitality,
every pleasure heightens it. On the contrary, the
assertion that pleasure-giving actions and life-preserving
actions coincide, is due to a hasty generalisation
which cannot include all the facts. That it
holds throughout a considerable extent is true.
Pleasure is, at any rate, a usual accompaniment
of the normal processes of the development of
life; and pain reaches its climax in death. But
yet there is a broad margin of experience for
which the generalisation is incorrect. There are
numerous cases of painful and pleasurable sensations
which cannot be shown to be, respectively,
destructive of, and beneficial to, vitality. As
Mr Bain, who always keeps the facts in view,
admits, with regard to the feelings connected with
the five senses, "we cannot contend that the degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>of augmented vital energy corresponds always
with the degree of the pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The same discrepancy
may be observed in more complex experiences.
The effort after a fuller life, whether physical or
mental, even when its ultimate success is not
doubtful, may bring more pain than pleasure;
while the life which never strains its powers
towards the limits of endurance, may experience
almost uninterrupted pleasure: but such pleasure
is the sure herald of the process of degeneration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(β) may be
held to depend
on
medium or
normal functioning.</div>

<p>The theory that pleasure follows increased vitality,
and pain decreased vitality, is supplemented or
opposed in modern psychology by the theory that
feeling depends on function: that pleasure is the
concomitant of medium activities,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> or of conscious
functioning, which is unimpeded and not overstrained<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>&mdash;pain
accompanying the opposite condition.
The objection urged against this view,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>that it leaves the so-called "passive pleasures"
out of account, seems to be made without sufficient
consideration of what is meant by attributing passivity
to pleasure. All that such an expression
can denote, would appear to be that, in the pleasurable
experience referred to, no exercise of the
muscles is implied, not that such an experience can
take place without any conscious activity on the
part of the subject. At the same time, the theory
that pleasure in all cases depends upon function,
must be admitted to be obliged to call in the aid of
hypothesis in order to explain all the facts. If the
generalisation required by the theory can be made
out, it must be by emphasising the fact that feeling
is never properly regarded as purely passive, but
implies subjective reaction; and by supposing that
the variation of feeling between pleasure and pain
depends on a difference in the character of this
subjective reaction. At the same time, the complete
accuracy of this generalisation is not of vital
importance here, as it is mainly with the feeling
which manifestly results from activity or functioning
that we are concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modification
of pleasurable
characteristics
of
objects</div>

<p>Whether pleasure depends upon increase of vital
energy, or upon unimpeded or medium functioning,
it must be subject to modification along with
the conditions under which life may continue and
increase, or the modes of activity which may be
carried on without opposition and in moderation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
This constant modification of the objects in which
one takes pleasure, or which give one pain, is, indeed,
a fact which must be admitted by any theory
of feeling. A state of mind may be at first pleasurable;
but, if it be long-continued, the pleasure
will give way to the pain of monotony. The same
is true of a painful state of mind: its continuance
does not prolong the same intensity of painful consciousness,
but the sensibility becomes dulled and
the pain diminishes. The transition is still more
striking in the case of motor activities. In learning
to walk, or to ride, or to play any instrument, the
first experiences are those of painful effort. Gradually,
however, the co-ordinations of movement
required entail less and less pain, till the feeling
passes over into its opposite, and we have a pleasurable
sense of successful effort and well-adapted
functioning. But, just as pain gave way to pleasure,
so pleasure itself subsides, the action becomes
merely reflex and passes out of consciousness altogether,
unless it be so long continued as to produce
fatigue&mdash;that is, pain. Habit, as Dumont
remarks,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> intensifies perceptions, but weakens pleasure
and pain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">suggests
that feeling
depends on
objective
intensity.</div>

<p>These are psychological facts&mdash;not mere theories&mdash;which
hold true even of the individual experience.
But they have led psychologists to the theory, supported
by a vast amount of direct experiment, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>there is no object or action which can be said to be
absolutely and in itself either pleasant or painful.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
The feeling of pleasure or pain accompanying the
object is a function of its intensity in relation to the
subject. This proposition cannot, indeed, be fully
demonstrated regarding each simple sensation: to
the emotions into which intricate relations of perceptions
enter, it does not apply, till their complexity
has been reduced. Some sensations and perceptions
are certainly felt as painful in any intensity in which
they are distinctly present to consciousness. But,
although this is a real difficulty, it does not seem
insuperable. The instances which Mill cites<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> to
throw doubt on the generalisation that quality of
feeling depends on intensity are unfortunately chosen
for his purpose. For&mdash;to take his example&mdash;the
taste of rhubarb is to many not painful but pleasant;
and, indeed, every case of acquired taste shows that
pleasure and pain can be modified through habit and
custom, and suggests that, even in the case of those
sensations which are painful in any form we have
been able to experience them, there is a degree of
intensity below which they would, if experienced,
be pleasant. Experiment has proved of the majority
even of sensible qualities, and analogy leads us to
conclude of all, that there is a degree in which each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>may be pleasant, and a degree in which each may
be painful, and, between them, a&mdash;real or imaginary&mdash;zero-point
of feeling, where there is neither pleasure
nor pain. This must, it is true, be received as
a hypothesis only; but it is a hypothesis which is
suggested by a wide range of facts, and which is
able to include even those facts with which it is
seemingly inconsistent, by supposing that could
their intensity be indefinitely diminished without
their passing out of consciousness, these sensations
would reach a point after which they would be felt
as pleasant and not as painful. Further, experiment
shows that this dividing-point which separates the
two poles of feeling is not always placed at the same
degree of intensity, that it differs not only for every
object, but for each individual subject as well, and
that it undergoes modification in the course of the
subject's development.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>What is true of sense-perception is still more
evident regarding those experiences in which the
activity of the subject is more obviously involved.
As any function may, if carried beyond a certain
degree of intensity, be painful, so any function consistent
with life may be a source of pleasure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the preceding discussion two things may be
inferred: first, the dependence of pleasure and pain
on the subject-activity, whether the activity be that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>of perception or of what is specifically called action;
and secondly, the modification of pleasure and pain,
and transition from one to the other, along with the
modification of that subject-activity. To the application
of both these conclusions there may be limits;
but their general accuracy does not seem doubtful.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>c</i>) Application
of the
theory of
evolution:<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
What the doctrine of evolution adds to this is its
proof of the indefinite modifiability of human function.
"It is an essential principle of life," Mr
Spencer wrote,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> before he had arrived at his general
theory of evolution, "that a faculty to which circumstances
do not allow full exercise diminishes; and
that a faculty on which circumstances make excessive
demands increases;" and to this we must now
add, "that, supposing it consistent with maintenance
of life, there is no kind of activity which will not
become a source of pleasure if continued; and that
therefore pleasure will eventually accompany every
mode of action demanded by social conditions."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
It is, he holds, a "biological truth," that "everywhere
faculties adjust themselves to the conditions of existence
in such wise that the activities those conditions
require become pleasurable."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The vast periods of
time over which evolution stretches are scarcely
needed to show how pleasure may be made to follow
from almost any course of action consistent with the
continuance of life. The change of habits which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>often takes place in the history of a nation, and even
in the life of an individual, makes this sufficiently
obvious. But, if we still think of making attainment
of pleasure the end of conduct, the doctrine of evolution
must give us pause. It has been already argued
that, given certain sources of, and susceptibilities for,
pleasure, the course of evolution has not been such
as to produce an exact coincidence between them
and the actions which further life.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>any conduct
consistent
with conditions
of life
will come to
be pleasurable;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But it would
seem that, given habits of acting which are consistent
with the conditions of life, and which are systematically
carried out, these will not fail to grow pleasant
as the organism becomes adapted to them. At
the best, it is difficult enough to say, even for the
individual, whether one imagined object or course of
action will exceed another in pleasurable feeling or
not. But, when we remember that function and
feeling may be modified indefinitely, it is impossible
to say what course of conduct will produce the
greatest amount of pleasure for the race. Taking
in all its effects, we cannot say that one way of
seeking pleasure is better&mdash;that is, will bring more
pleasure&mdash;than another. Bearing in mind the modifications
which evolution produces, it seems impossible
to guide the active tendencies of mankind
towards the goal of greatest pleasure, except by
saying that the greatest pleasure will be got from
the greatest amount of successful, or of unrestrained,
or of medium activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">maximum
pleasure
only definable
in terms
of life.</div>

<p>If, then, we have been seeking to define the evolutionist
end by interpreting it in terms of pleasure,
it appears that we have only succeeded in making
the round of a circle: pleasure as the end is seen to
be only definable as life or activity, although it was
adopted as the end in order that by its help we might
discover what life or activity meant as the end for
conduct. We may, perhaps, still be able to hold to
a form of hedonism, if we turn our attention from
the race to a small portion of present mankind. In
spite of the modifiability of function and its parasite
feeling, we may still be able to say that such and
such a course of action is likely to bring most
pleasure to the individual or even to the family.
But we cannot extend such a means of interpreting
the ethics of evolution to the race, where the possibility
of modification is indefinitely great, and the
pain incurred in initiating a change counts for little
in comparison with its subsequent results. If we
continue to look from the evolutionist point of view,
the question, What conduct will on the whole bring
most pleasure? can only be answered by saying
that it is the conduct which will most promote life&mdash;an
answer which might have been more satisfactory
had it not been to give meaning to this end
"promotion of life" that it was interpreted in terms
of greatest pleasure. The evolution-theory of ethics
is thus seen to oscillate from the theory which looks
upon the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i> as pleasure, to that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
finds it in activity. It contains elements which
make it impossible for it to adhere to the former
alternative. The comprehensiveness of its view of
life makes it unable to adopt pleasure as the end,
since pleasure changes with every modification of
function. And it has now to be seen whether the
empirical method of interpretation to which it
adheres will allow of its notion of life or activity
affording a satisfactory end for conduct.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>THE EVOLUTIONIST END.</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Want of harmony
between
evolutionism
and
hedonism.</div>

<p>In showing the important bearing which evolution
has on the causes of pleasure, the argument of the
preceding chapter has also made clear that the ends
of evolutionism and of hedonism cannot be made to
explain one another. The theory which starts with
a maximum of pleasure as the ultimate end, but
points to the course of evolution as showing how
that end is to be realised, is confronted by the fact
that the development of life does not always tend
to increased pleasure, and that the laws of its
development cannot therefore be safely adopted as
maxims for the attainment of pleasure. The same
objection may be taken to the method of interpreting
the evolutionist end by means of the pleasurable
results of conduct. The two do not correspond with
that exactness which would admit of one doing duty
for the other as a practical guide. And a further
difficulty has been shown to stand in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
this method. For, on coming to analyse pleasure,
we find that it may, by habituation, arise from any&mdash;or
almost any&mdash;course of conduct which the conditions
of existence admit of. The evolutionist,
therefore, can have no surer idea of greatest pleasure&mdash;even
although this may not be a very sure
one&mdash;than that it will follow in the train of the
greatest or most varied activity which harmonises
with the laws of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of
investigating
independent
evolutionist
end.</div>

<p>We must therefore forsake the method of eclecticism,
and inquire whether the theory of evolution
can make any independent contribution towards
determining an end for conduct. We are frequently
told that it prescribes as the end "preservation," or
"development," or "the health of the society." But
to obtain a clear meaning for such notions, we must
see what definite content the theory of evolution
can give them,&mdash;without considering, at present, the
grounds for transforming them into ethical precepts.
Now, it may be thought&mdash;and the suggestion
deserves careful examination&mdash;that we may
find in the characteristics of evolution itself<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> an
indication of the end which organisms produced
by and subject to evolution are naturally fitted to
attain. These characteristics must therefore be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>passed under review, that their ethical bearings
may be seen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">1. Adaptation
to environment:
necessary
for life;</div>

<p>1. The first condition of development, and even
of life, is correspondence between an organism and
its environment. The waste implied in the processes
which constitute the life of an organised
body has to be supplied by nutriment got from
surrounding objects. It requires food, air, light,
and heat in due proportions in order that its various
organs may do their work. When these circumstances
change, either it adapts itself to the new
conditions or death ensues. Thus "we find that
every animal is limited to a certain range of climate;
every plant to certain zones of latitude and
elevation,"<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>&mdash;though nothing differs more among
different species than the extent of an organism's
adaptability to varying conditions. A definite organism
and a medium suitable to it are called by
Comte the two "fundamental correlative conditions
of life"; according to Mr Spencer they constitute
life. "Conformity" is absolutely necessary between
"the vital functions of any organism and the conditions
in which it is placed." In this conformity
there are varying degrees, and "the completeness
of the life will be proportionate to the completeness
of the correspondence."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Even when life is not
altogether extinguished, it is impeded by imperfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>adaptation. Where external circumstances make
the attainment of nourishment difficult and precarious,
life is shortened in extent, and, within its
limits, more occupied with simply maintaining its
necessary functions&mdash;less full, varied, and active.
The same holds good whether the external circumstances
are natural or social,&mdash;applies equally to
those whose energies are exhausted in the production
of a bare livelihood from a niggard soil and
unpropitious climate, and to those who, under
changed conditions, feel the hardship of adapting
themselves to a new social medium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">spoken of as
the ethical
end;</div>

<p>Shall we say, then, that the end of human conduct
is adaptation to environment? This seems to be
the position taken up by some evolutionists. In
the language of von Baer,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> "the end of ends is
always that the organic body be adapted to the
conditions of the earth, its elements and means of
nutriment;" and Mr Spencer holds "that all evil
results from the non-adaptation of constitution to
condition."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The hedonism which Mr Spencer
definitely accepts as his ethical principle prevents
him, indeed, from fully adopting the theory of
human action which von Baer seems to regard as
the result of the doctrine of evolution. Yet complete
adaptation of constitution to condition is held
by him to be characteristic of that perfect form of
life to which evolution tends, and the laws of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>are to be our guides in our present imperfect social
condition. In working out his theory of ethics, he
describes acts as "good or bad according as they
are well or ill adjusted to ends," identifying the
good with "the conduct furthering self-preservation,"
and the bad with "the conduct tending to
self-destruction."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The notion of self-preservation
thus introduced is naturally suggested as the end
subserved by the activity of an organism being
adjusted to surrounding conditions. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>defines the
notion of
self-preservation.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Self-preservation,
therefore, rather than adaptation to environment,
will be regarded as the end, with which adaptation
will be connected as the essential means.</p>

<p>This notion of self-preservation has played a
remarkable part in ethical and psychological discussion
since the time of the Stoics. It withdraws
attention from the relative and transient feeling of
pleasure to the permanence of the living being.
Thus, with the Stoics, the notion of self-preservation
was accompanied by an ethics hostile to indulgence
in pleasure; while, on the other hand, in
Spinoza and in Hobbes, pleasure was recognised
as the natural consequence of self-preserving acts&mdash;the
former defining it as a transition from less to
greater perfection, the latter as the sense of what
helps the vital functions. The theory of evolution
has, of course, not only its distinctive contribution
to make to the connection between self-preservation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>and pleasure&mdash;a subject already referred to,&mdash;but
also shows how an increasing harmony has been
produced between acts which tend to self-preservation
and those which tend to social-preservation.
With Mr Spencer these two points are united. His
doctrine that the "conduct which furthers race-maintenance
evolves hand-in-hand with the conduct
which furthers self-maintenance"<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> is preliminary
to the establishment of the proposition that
the highest life is one in which egoistic and "altruistic"
acts harmonise with one another and with
external conditions: "the life called moral is one in
which this moving equilibrium reaches completeness
or approaches most nearly to completeness."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Self-preservation
and
social-preservation.</div>

<p>As has been already pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> it is not the
case, in the present state of human life, that egoistic
and altruistic tendencies, even when properly understood,
always lead to the same course of conduct;
and even the theory of evolution does not do away
with the necessity for a "compromise" between
them. But, even had the theory of evolution overcome
the opposition between the individual and
social standpoints, much would still remain to
be done for the purpose of constructing a system
of ethics, or determining the ethical end. It seems
better, therefore, to pass over at present the conflict
of competing interests. According to Pascal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>"the entire succession of men, the whole course of
ages, is to be regarded as one man always living
and always learning." And this is a suggestion
which the theory of evolution only states more
definitely, though it cannot completely vindicate
it. On this supposition, self-preservation <em>is</em> social-preservation,
and the possibly divergent interests
of the individual and the whole are left out of
account. The end for the race then is, according
to the theory most explicitly stated by von Baer,
a state of "moving equilibrium": and to this state
of affairs we are at least, Mr Spencer holds, indubitably
tending. In the final stage of human development,
man will be perfectly adapted to the conditions
of his environment, so that, to each change
without, there will be an answering organic change.
The ideal which seems to be held up to us is that
of a time in which there will be no more irksome
fretting in the machinery of life, and circumstances
will never be unpropitious, because the organism
will never be wanting in correspondence with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) As the
end for
present
conduct:
opposed to
progress;</div>

<p>If this adaptation be adopted as the practical
end for conduct under present conditions, and not
merely as describing a far-off ideal to which we
are supposed to be tending, man may continue to
manifest a law of progress, but its initiation will
be from external conditions. If "adaptation to environment"
is consistently made the end, activity
will have to be restricted to suiting one's powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to an external order of nature, and desire will have
to be curbed when it does not bring the means
of satisfaction along with it. "Bene latere" will
again be an equivalent for "bene vivere," and happiness
will have to be sought in withdrawal from the
distractions of political life, and in the restriction
of desire. It is strange to see the theory which
is supposed to be based upon and to account for
progress, returning in this way to an ideal similar
to that in which the post-Aristotelian schools took
refuge amid the decline of political and intellectual
life in Greece. The end which Stoic and Epicurean
alike sought in complete emancipation from the
conditions of the external world,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> is now, in more
scientific phrase, made to consist in complete harmony
with these conditions. But, in their practical
results, the two theories would seem scarcely to
differ. It is not astonishing, therefore, if this gospel
of renunciation finds little favour among practical
men in our day. It is seen that, if a man
has not wants, he will make no efforts, and that,
if he make no efforts, his condition can never be
bettered. Thus social reformers have often found
that the classes they have tried to elevate did not
feel the evil of their lot as their benefactors saw it,
and they have had to create wants before attempting
to satisfy them.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> And the practical tendency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>finds its counterpart in speculative opinion, so that,
whereas Epicurus placed happiness in freedom
from wants, modern hedonism usually considers a
man the happier the more wants he has and is able
to supply.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">does not
fully represent
the
theory of
evolution.</div>

<p>This practical tendency brings out the truth that
it is not only by the subordination of self to circumstances,
and the restriction of desire to present
means of satisfaction, that the required harmony
between outer and inner relations can be brought
about. The other alternative is open: circumstances
may be subordinated to self. For this latter
alternative the theory of evolution seems really
to leave room as much as for the former. It is excluded
only when a one-sided emphasis is laid on
the necessity of adaptation to environment. For
evolution implies a gradually increasing heterogeneity
of structure as the prelude to perfect agreement
with circumstances: "the limit of heterogeneity
towards which every aggregate progresses is
the formation of as many specialisations and combinations
of parts as there are specialised and combined
forces to be met."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The end of evolution is a
correspondence between inner and outer which is
not produced by the easy method of both being very
simple, but which is consistent with, and indeed
requires, the complexity and heterogeneity produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>in both by constant interaction.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The greater
this complexity, the more filled with sensation,
emotion, and thought life is, the greater is what Mr
Spencer calls its "breadth." But, if "adaptation"
is still regarded as expressing the end, then, the
more perfect this adaptation is, the less room seems
left for progress, and the end of human conduct is
placed in a state of moving equilibrium in which
action takes place without a jar and without disturbing
the play of external conditions.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) As describing
the
ultimate
condition of
life,</div>

<p>This end of "adaptation" is looked upon by Mr
Spencer not as representing the conduct prescribed
by morality in present circumstances, but as describing
the ultimate condition of human life. As such,
it is the foundation of his Absolute Ethics&mdash;that
"final permanent code" which "alone admits of
being definitely formulated, and so constituting
ethics as a science in contrast with empirical
ethics."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The "philosophical moralist," he tells us,
"treats solely of the <em>straight</em> man. He determines
the properties of the straight man; describes how
the straight man comports himself; shows in what
relationship he stands to other straight men; shows
how a community of straight men is constituted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>Any deviation from strict rectitude he is obliged
wholly to ignore. It cannot be admitted into his
premisses without vitiating all his conclusions. A
problem in which a <em>crooked</em> man forms one of the
elements is insoluble by him."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">complete
correspondence
with
environment.</div>

<p>How, then, are we to conceive the nature or conduct
of the "straight man"? To begin with, it is
made clear that his dealings are only with straight
men; for there are no "crooked men" in the ideal
community. "The coexistence of a perfect man
and an imperfect society is impossible; and could
the two coexist the resulting conduct would not
furnish the ethical standard sought."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> "The ultimate
man is one in whom this process [of adaptation
to the social state] has gone so far as to produce
a correspondence between all the promptings of his
nature and all the requirements of his life as carried
on in society. If so, it is a necessary implication
that there exists an ideal code of conduct formulating
the behaviour of the completely-adapted
man in the completely-evolved society." <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Resultant
absolute
code of
ethics<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This is
the code of Absolute Ethics, whose injunctions alone
are "absolutely right," and which, "as a system of
ideal conduct, is to serve as a standard for our guidance
in solving, as well as we can, the problems of
real conduct."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> At the outset, we were required to
"interpret the more developed by the less developed;"<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the conclusion sets forth that the less developed
is to be guided by the more developed, the
real by the ideal. Now, ethics "includes all conduct
which furthers or hinders, in either direct or
indirect ways, the welfare of self or others."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Thus
Absolute Ethics, like Relative Ethics, has two divisions,
personal and social. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(α) lays
down abstract
principles
for
relation of
individual
to society;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
As to the latter, Mr
Spencer formulates certain principles of justice,
negative beneficence, and positive beneficence,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> which
describe the harmonious co-operation of ideal men
in the ideal state. These principles may perhaps
be capable of a modified application to the present
state of society, in which there is a conflict of interests:
although Mr Spencer's representation of
them&mdash;which is still, however, incomplete&mdash;suggests
the belief that they are not so much guides which
the ideal gives to the real, as suggestions for the
construction of a Utopia gathered from the requirements
of present social life. But, supposing the
"harmonious co-operation" of individuals to be
thus provided for, what is the personal end?

society has any further function than regulating

are various types of activities, all of which may belong
to lives "complete after their kinds." But yet
"perfection of individual life" does imply "certain
modes of action which are approximately alike in
all cases, and which, therefore, become part of the
subject-matter of ethics." We cannot lay down
"precise rules for private conduct," but only "general
requirements." And these are: to maintain
the balance between waste and nutrition, to observe
a relation between activity and rest, to marry and
have children.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> This is "how the straight man comports

thrown out that a man's function may be the
realisation of a type of activity complete after its

that we can say of the "completely-adapted

<p>We have a right to demur if the pleasures of the
final condition of equilibrium be held up to our
imagination as a reason for aiming at it. That it
is "the establishment of the greatest perfection
and most complete happiness,"<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> seems an unwarrantable
assumption. Yet it is through this assumption
that an apparent harmony between Mr
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>Spencer's hedonistic ethics and his view of the
tendency of evolution is brought about. It is not
at all certain that the result of perfectly adapted
function is great increase of pleasure. It is true
that all the pains of disharmony between inner
desire or feeling and outer circumstances would,
in such a case, disappear; but with them also there
would be lost the varied pleasures of pursuit and
successful struggle. It cannot even be assumed
that other pleasures would continue as intense as
before. For, as acts are performed more easily,
and thus with less conscious volition, they gradually
pass into the background of consciousness, or
out of consciousness altogether; and the pleasure
accompanying them fades gradually away as they
cease to occupy the attention. "Where action is
perfectly automatic, feeling does not exist."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The
so-called passive pleasures might still remain. But
the fact of effort being no longer necessary for the
adjustment of inner to outer relations might have
the effect of making the "moving equilibrium"
still called "life" automatic in every detail.
Indeed, if the suggestions of the 'First Principles'
are to be carried out, it would seem that the
moving equilibrium is "a transitional state on the
way to complete equilibrium,"<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> which is another

pleasure being the result of completely perfect
adjustment of inner to outer relations, this adjustment
would seem to reach its natural goal in unconsciousness&mdash;a
conclusion which may commend
itself to those of Mr Spencer's disciples who take
a less optimist view of life than their master.</p>

<p>It seems evident, therefore, that to take adaptation
to environment, or self-preservation as interpreted
by adaptation, as the end of conduct, is to
adopt an end which cannot be shown to be desirable
on the ground of yielding a maximum of happiness
or pleasure. And it is almost with a feeling of
relief that one finds Mr Spencer's confidence in
the tendency of evolution so far shaken as to admit
of his saying that "however near to completeness
the adaptation of human nature to the conditions
of existence at large, physical and social, may become,
it can never reach completeness."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> "Adaptation
to environment" must, at any rate, be kept
quite distinct from any theory of ethics which
takes pleasure as the end of life; and it cannot
consistently determine any result as of ethical
value on account of its pleasurable consequences.
The goal it sets before us, and in which human
progress ends, is conformity with an external order.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>The modification of these external conditions by
human effort is to be justified ethically by the
opportunity it gives for bringing about a fuller
agreement between the individual or race and its
environment. The result is a stationary state of
human conduct, corresponding with, or a part of,
that general "equilibration" to which, according to
Mr Spencer, all evolution tends. But this theory,
which places the goal of conduct in what seems to
be the actual tendency of evolution, gains no real
support from this apparent harmony of ethics with
general philosophy. It may be granted that the
evidence of physical laws goes to show that the
evolution of the solar, or even stellar, system is
towards a condition in which the "moving equilibrium"
will at last pass into a form in which
there is no further sensible motion, and the concentration
of matter is complete. But to infer
from this that the theory which places the end
of conduct in a similar equilibrium shows the
harmony of morality with the tendency of existence
in general, would really involve a confusion
of the two different meanings of "end." The end
or termination of all things may be equilibrium,
motionlessness, or dissolution, but this is no reason
why the end or aim of conduct should be a similar
equilibrium.</p>

<p>Indeed, to say that we ought to promote the end
of evolution, and that this end is annihilation, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
inconsistent with the postulate always implied by
the ethics of evolution&mdash;the postulate that conduct
should promote evolution because life is desirable,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
and increase of life comes with the progress
of evolution. Nor is it of any assistance to reply
to this by saying that the dissolution in which
evolution ends may be only the prelude to another
process of evolution in which life will gradually
progress till it again reaches equilibrium. For, in
the first place, this is only a problematical suggestion&mdash;is
not, to speak in Mr Spencer's language,
"demonstrable <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> by deduction from the persistence
of force," as the tendency of present evolution
to equilibrium is held to be; and secondly,
the new process, if it were to come about, would
have to begin again the slow ascent from the lowest
rung of the ladder of existence: so that, in aiding
evolution towards the goal of equilibrium, we
should be only guiding it to the old starting-point
which has now, after many a painful struggle, been
left far behind.</p>

<p>But further, it would seem that the theory of
evolution itself is not fairly represented by a view
which emphasises the fact of adaptation to environment
to the exclusion of that of variation. The
latter is as necessary to progressive development
as the former. Adaptation to environment might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>seem to be most nearly complete when organism
and environment were both so simple as to be
hardly separate. The polype, which is scarcely
different from the sea-water it inhabits, might
seem by correspondence with its medium to be
near the maximum of adaptation, though at the
very beginning of life. It may be solely because
the environment is subject to numerous changes
that the organism of simple structure cannot maintain
life. But it is only through its own inherent
power of variation that progress in organic life is
possible. Perfect correspondence with the environment
was not reached by simple organisms, not
only on account of the want of uniformity in their
surroundings, <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>tendency to
variation in
all organisms,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
but also because there is in every
organism a tendency to variation through which
the modifications are produced which natural selection
takes hold of. Did organisms not tend to vary
in function and structure, no progressive modification
would be possible. Those fittest to live would
be selected once for all, and all but those adapted
to the environment weeded out.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for our present purpose to
have any definite theory of the obscure laws by
which this variability is governed.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> It is enough
that natural selection requires the striking out of
new modifications as well as the transmission of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>those already produced.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> It may be the fact that
variation is, in the last resort, due to changes in
surrounding circumstances, to the unequal incidence
of external forces upon a finite aggregate.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
But, with living bodies as now constituted, it has,
at any rate as proximate cause, a twofold source.
It may be due to the direct effect of external forces,
or it may be caused by the energy stored up in the
organism in growth.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">consciously
directed in
man.</div>

<p>In man the outgo of this force is conscious; and,
by means of his conscious or intelligent volition,
governed by interests of various kinds, he can
anticipate and modify the action of natural
selection. The law that the fittest organism survives
may perhaps work in man as in the lower
animals, if only we give a wide enough meaning
to "fittest," so as to admit even of the weak being
made fit through the sympathy and help of the
strong. Natural selection becomes dependent upon
variations of a kind different from those in the
merely animal world, so that its practical effect
may be in some cases apparently reversed. We
thus see how it is that even Darwin holds that in
moralised societies "natural selection apparently
effects but little,"<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> at the same time that we may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>not be inclined to deny the truth of Schäffle's contention<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
that, although circumstances differ, the
law of action remains the same. Schäffle points
out how, as we rise in the scale of life, especially
as it is manifested in human society, the organisation
becomes more delicate, and other than merely
natural facts have to be taken account of, so that
the fittest to live in the new social and intellectual
environment is no longer the man of greatest
physical strength and skill.</p>

<p>The theory of natural selection as applied to the
ordinary spheres of plant and animal life, may perhaps,
for some purposes, neglect consideration of
the fact that it presupposes a tendency to variation
in the organisms whose growth it describes. But,
when the variation in the behaviour of the organism
becomes conscious and designed, there is thereby
produced a preliminary indication or determination
of the lines on which natural selection is to work.
And, before the theory of evolution can give a full
account of the ethical in man, it must distinguish
consciously-determined from merely natural action,
and give an analysis of what is implied in the
former. We must bear in mind that it may be the
case that the ground and possibility of progress
and of the efficiency of ideal ends in human conduct&mdash;which
"adaptation to environment" has been
unable logically to explain or leave room for&mdash;are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>to be found in this differentiating fact of conscious
activity. But we must first of all see whether,
from the empirical characteristics of variation, we
can extract an ethical end or any guide for
conduct.</p>

<p>2. "The lower animals," says a writer on biology,
"are just as well organised for the purposes of their
life as the higher are for theirs. The tape-worm is
relatively quite as perfect as the man, and distinguished
from him by many superior capabilities."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
It is incorrect to look upon the evolution
of animal life as working upon one line, so that the
different kinds of living beings can be arranged, as
it were, in an order of merit, in which the organisation
of the higher animal plainly excels that of
the lower. The conditions of life are manifold and
various enough to permit of the existence of many
species equally perfect in relation to their environments.
The fact that we are still able to speak of
one species or one animal as higher than another,
is not owing to the one being better adapted to its
environment than the other, but is supposed rather
to be due to the higher forms having "their organs
more distinctly specialised for different functions."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
Even Mr Spencer, for whom equilibrium is the goal
of life, implicitly admits that "adaptation" alone is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>not the end of human action, by his doctrine that
the degree of evolution may be measured by the
complexity of the adjustments it effects between
organism and environment. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>a</i>) prescribes
self-development
rather than
self-preservation,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The end, therefore, it
may be said, is no longer the mere "self-preservation"
found in adaptation to environment, but the
"self-development" which implies temporary disharmony
between organism and surroundings.</p>

<p>For "self-preservation" and "self-development,"
though frequently spoken of as identical, are really
distinct and often opposed notions&mdash;the former denoting
a tendency to persist in one's present state
of being, while the latter implies more or less
change. It may be held, however, that for an
organism such as man to persist in his state of
being, implies modification of his faculties, and that
this modification involves development. For any
organism to exist apart from change is, of course,
impossible. Life is only known to us as a series of
changes. But that change does not necessarily
mean development or "change to a higher condition."
Degradation is as well known a fact as
development; and between the two, there is room
for a state of existence of which it is difficult to
say whether it improves or deteriorates. And
whatever may be intended by the phrase, "self-preservation"
points to a state of this kind rather
than to an improving condition. The notion of
"self-development" has therefore a richer content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
than that of "self-preservation"; but just on this
account it cannot be explained by a reference to
the nature of things as they are.</p>

<div class="sidenote">thus taking
account of
variability</div>

<p>It is true that self-development can only go on
by a continuous process of adjustment; but it is
also necessary for it that this tendency to adaptation
should be continually hindered from becoming
complete or lapsing into equilibrium. It is here
that the function of variation comes in. On the
one side there is this tendency to vary after a
fashion often without any apparent regard to external
conditions; on the other side, there is the
action of the external conditions selecting and
favouring those variations which bring the organism
into closer correspondence with them. The
wide range over which the theory of natural selection
applies is due to the fact that the environment
is never uniform and never constant, so that modifications
on the part of the organism have a chance
of suiting its varied and changing character. Its
changes, moreover, are often the result not so much
of any absolute alteration in external circumstances,
as of a new relation between them and living beings
having been brought about. For the enormous reproductive
faculty of most organisms makes them
multiply so rapidly as to press ever more and more
closely against the limit of subsistence, and thus
to produce competition for the means of living.
Hence the fresh lines of development originated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
by each organism have to be tested by their correspondence
with a constantly changing medium.
The altered circumstances give the modifications
which organisms are for ever striking out an
opportunity of perpetuating themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">which complicates
the
tendency to
correspondence
with
environment,</div>

<p>By each new variation the existing relation
between organism and environment is disturbed.
The variation may, however, prove its utility at
once by a more exact correspondence than before
with the requirements of external conditions. But,
in what are called the higher grades of life, variations
from the type are sometimes not immediately
useful, although they may ultimately become most
advantageous.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Were it not for the remarkable
power of persistence possessed by the higher
animals, the modified organism would be unable
to hold its own. The great majority of such
eccentric or extraordinary variations do, as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>matter of fact, soon disappear, because unable to
prove their utility. But others of them, either by
the power they give the organism to mould circumstances
to itself, or by their appropriateness to the
greater complexity which comes with the increased
number of living organisms, and the more delicate
readjustment it requires, prove themselves to be
fitter to live than if no variation had taken place
and the preceding state of relative equilibrium
had been maintained. The higher adjustment of
life to its surroundings, which marks each stage of
advancing evolution, had its beginning in the rupture
of the original simpler harmony that previously
existed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">especially
in human
conduct.</div>

<p>If we compare human conduct with that of
animals lower in the organic scale, it becomes
evident that there is a broad difference between
the two in this, that actions in the former are
purposed, performed with a definite end in view;
whereas, in the latter, they seem to be the blind
result of impulse, and there are slight, if any,
traces of purpose. In activity of the latter kind,
natural selection works in the ordinary way by
choosing for survival the animals which behave so
as best to suit their environment. But actions
done with a view to an end may anticipate the
verdict of this natural law. The agent may see
that conduct of a particular kind would conduce
to the promotion of life, while conduct of a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
kind would render him less fit to live; and,
as a consequence, the former action may be chosen.
In this way development may be anticipated, and
the present order of affairs may be disturbed, more
or less forcibly, in order to bring about a foreseen
better state of things.</p>

<p>We are thus able to see more clearly how it is
that the theory of evolution may be thought to
give rise to two different ethical ends. The first
of these is the theory already criticised, "adaptation
to environment," which corresponds to the notion
of self-preservation. But this end, as we have
seen, only takes one side of the theory of evolution
into consideration&mdash;neglects the tendency to variation
which evolution postulates, and which, in the
higher organisms, becomes purposed. The other
end which seems to be suggested by the theory of
evolution takes account of this tendency to variation,
and may be said to correspond to the notion
of self-development; but this end it is harder to
define. Adaptation we can easily understand by
a reference to the environment to which life is
to be adapted. This involves a knowledge of the
conditions of the environment, but nothing more.
Development can be measured by no such standard.
On the one hand it implies an independent, or
relatively independent, tendency to variation. On
the other hand, however, it is necessary that the
disharmony with environment, in which this tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to variation may begin, should not be excessive
and should not be permanent; for without a
certain amount of adaptation to environment no
organism can live. The extent of initial disharmony
which is possible, or is useful, varies according
to the versatility of the faculties of each individual
organism, and to its place in the scale of
being; but throughout all existence it is true that
want of adaptation beyond a certain varying degree
is fatal: "a mode of action entirely alien to the
prevailing modes of action, cannot be successfully
persisted in&mdash;must eventuate in death of self, or
posterity, or both."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) Standard
for measuring
development</div>

<p>By what standard, then, can we measure development?
We have already seen, from the "formula,"
as it is called, or definition, of evolution, that it
implies an advance to a state of increased coherence,
definiteness, and heterogeneity, by the double process
of differentiation of parts, and integration of these
parts into a whole by the formation of definite
relations to one another. The notions of coherence
amongst parts and of increased definiteness of
function and structure are easily understood. But
the heterogeneity postulated is a more complex
notion,&mdash;has, in the first place, a double reference,
"is at the same time a differentiation of the parts
from each other and a differentiation of the consolidated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>whole from the environment;"<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and secondly,
is manifested in living beings in increased
complexity of every kind&mdash;of structure, form,
chemical composition, specific gravity, temperature,
and self-mobility.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Can we then apply this at
once to ethics, and say that the most developed&mdash;that
is, the most moral&mdash;conduct is that which is
most definite, coherent, and heterogeneous? This
doctrine has at least the merit of not leaving out
of sight so fundamental a characteristic of evolution
as the tendency to variation; and, without being
consistently held to, it is the burden of much of
Mr Spencer's 'Data of Ethics,' where it is illustrated
and defended with great ingenuity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">found in
degree of
complexity
of act and
motive.</div>

<p>That moral conduct is distinguished by definiteness
and coherence&mdash;that it works towards a determinate
end, and that its various actions are in
agreement with one another and parts of a whole&mdash;may
be admitted. But this is at most a merely
formal description of what is meant by morality in
conduct. To say that conduct must be a coherent
whole, and must seek a determinate end by appropriate
means, leaves unsettled the question as to
what this end should be, or what means are best
fitted to attain it. But, when we go on to say that
as conduct is more varied in act,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> more heterogeneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>in motive,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> it is higher in the moral scale, we
seem to have got hold of something which may
be a guide for determining the ethical end. The
mark of what is higher in evolution, and consequently
in morality, will be greater heterogeneity
or complexity.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>This conclusion follows from an attempt not
merely to treat "moral phenomena as phenomena
of evolution," but also to find the "ultimate interpretations"
of ethics "only in those fundamental
truths which are common to all" the sciences,
physical, biological, psychological, sociological.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>

have in common are those only which are most
abstract. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Difficulties
of the
theory:<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But as we pass from mere relations between
matter and motion to life, and from life
to self-consciousness, we have something different
from these fundamental truths with the addition
of certain others not fundamental: we find that
things are not merely more complex; but are
changed in aspect and nature. Even though it
be true that the new phenomena may still admit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>of analysis into the old simpler terms, and that
life, mind, and society may be interpreted as redistributions
of matter and motion,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> it must yet at
least be admitted that the change passed through
is one similar to those which Mill compared to
chemical composition: the new compound differs
fundamentally in mode of action from the elements
out of which it was formed. Now, in saying that
the most complex adjustments of acts to ends are
the highest kinds of conduct, and that we should
be guided by the more complex in preference to
simpler motives, this obvious difficulty is passed
over. It is true that Mr Spencer, in chapters rich
in suggestion, and filled with skilfully chosen
illustrations, has passed in review the various
aspects of conduct according as we look at it from
the point of view of the physical environment,
of life, of mind, or of society. But when these
different aspects are brought together and compared,
it becomes clear that the attempt to judge
conduct by reference to the "fundamental truth"
that evolution implies an advance towards greater
complexity, must necessarily end in failure.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">(α) antinomy
produced by
it between
the social
and individual
ends;</div>

<p>In the first place, there is a notable discrepancy
between the biological and the sociological
aspect. For the complete development of the
individual life implies that every function should
be fulfilled, and that its fulfilment should interfere
with the performance of no other function. "The
performance of every function is, in a sense, a moral
obligation." "The ideally moral man ... is one
in whom the functions of all kinds are duly fulfilled,"&mdash;that
is to say, "discharged in degrees duly
adjusted to the conditions of existence."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> A fully
evolved life is marked by multiplicity and complexity
of function. And, if from the individual we
pass to the social organism, we find that the same
truth holds. The state, or organised body of individuals,
has many functions to perform; but it
can only perform them in the most efficient way
through the functions of its individual members
being specialised. From the social point of view,
therefore, the greatest possible division of labour is
a mark of the most evolved and perfect community.
And this division of labour implies that each individual,
instead of performing every function of
which he is capable, should be made to restrict
himself to that at which he is best, so that the
community may be the gainer from the time and
exertion that are saved, and the skill that is produced,
by the most economic expenditure of individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>talent. Thus social perfection appears to
imply a condition of things inconsistent with that
development of one's whole nature which, from the
biological point of view, has just been defined as a
characteristic of the ideally moral man. It seems,
indeed, inevitable that any such abstract preliminary
notion of development as that which would
test it by increase of complexity must fail in such a
case as this where there is no question between the
competing claims of two phenomena on the same
level, but where harmony is wanted between the
different aspects the same phenomena present when
looked at from the point of view of the individual
and from the point of view of the whole.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(β) its psychological
aspect</div>

<p>There is still greater difficulty in applying this
criterion, when we come to the psychological aspect
of morality&mdash;the aspect most prominent in modern
philosophy from the revival of independent
ethical speculation till the time of Kant. According
to Mr Spencer, "the acts characterised by the
more complex motives and the more involved
thoughts, have all along been of higher authority
for guidance."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> But the later or more advanced
in mental evolution is not always more complex in
structure; for it is a characteristic of mental development
that the processes by which a result has been
arrived at gradually disappear on account of the diminished
attention they receive, so that there remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>what is, so far as psychical structure is concerned, a
simple mental state. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>confounds
complexity
of structure
with indirectness
of
origin,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Complexity of structure and
indirectness of origin are thus really two different
characteristics of states of mind, which frequently
go together, but frequently part company.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> When
Mr Spencer, accordingly, goes on to say<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> that "for
the better preservation of life the primitive simple
presentative feelings must be controlled by the
later-evolved compound and representative feelings,"
he is really passing to a different standard
without giving up the former. The sympathy with
injured Zulus or Afghans which would be approved
by Mr Spencer<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> may be a more indirect, representative,
or re-representative feeling, than the sentiments
which led to British invasion, and, as such,
may be more to be commended. But it would be
rash to say that sympathy with the "British interests"
supposed to be at stake&mdash;interests of commerce,
and of the balance of political power, as
well as those arising from the subtle effect of
national prestige&mdash;is less complex than the feeling
of sympathy with a people dispossessed of its territory.
The latter feeling may be more indirect or
representative, as implying an imaginative appropriation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>of the circumstances of another community;
but, so far as structure is concerned, it is composed
of far fewer and simpler component elements than
the feeling for British interests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">neither of
which can
serve as an
ethical
standard.</div>

<p>Nor, on the other hand, can we allow ourselves
to take refuge in the conclusion that, if the more
complex emotion cannot be held to be better
morally, then that which is later in evolution may
at least be regarded as of higher authority than the
earlier evolved feeling. According to Mr Spencer,
the man who obtains by fraud the money to support
his family is to be condemned, because, although we
admit the claim his family have upon him, "we
regard as of superior authority the feelings which
respond to men's proprietary claims&mdash;feelings which
are re-representative in a higher degree and refer
to more remote diffused consequences."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> But were
this the ground of distinction, we ought also to
regard the feelings prompting a man to distribute
his fortune in any foolish enterprise "as of superior
authority" to those which prompt him to support
his family, if only the former are "re-representative
in a higher degree," and their consequences more
"remote" and "diffused." Many of the greatest
evils which infect social life and warp the moral
feelings of men, are evils which are only possible
as the result of a highly advanced civilisation and
a refined and delicate organisation of the mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>The factitious sentiments raised by a subtle casuistry
with the effect of confusing the ordinary distinctions
of right and wrong are, in almost all cases,
more indirect and re-representative than the feelings
in harmony with the moral consciousness of the
community which they set aside in the individual
conscience. So obvious, indeed, are objections of
this kind&mdash;objections, that is to say, taken from
the impossibility of so applying the criterion as
to construct a workable system of morals&mdash;that
Mr Spencer virtually relinquishes his own theory,
talking of it as true only "on the average,"<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and
even allowing that it is in some cases suicidal.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>As it cannot be held that the more complex in
evolution is of greater authority than the less
complex, nor that the later in evolution has such
authority over the earlier, we must admit that the
so-called "fundamental characteristics" of evolution,
which find a place in its definition or "formula,"
are unable to determine its value in an
ethical regard. The richness of life, physical, intellectual,
and social, has indeed been produced
only as the result of a long course of development,
and by the assimilation of many various elements
into a complex organisation; but its value cannot
be measured either by the test of mechanical complexity,
or by the length of time it has taken to
evolve. We must therefore seek some other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>method of giving a meaning to evolution in the
region of moral values; and we find Mr Spencer
himself really falling back in his discussion on the
more general answer to our question, that the end
of evolution is life: "evolution becomes the highest
possible when the conduct simultaneously achieves
the greatest totality of life in self, offspring, and
fellow-men."<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Since it appears, then, that the characteristic
of complexity or variety is as unsatisfactory
a criterion of morality, as the notion of
"adaptation to environment" was found to be, we
must ask for some further interpretation of the
notion of "development" or "increase of life"
when regarded as the end of conduct.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">3. Further
attempt to
define development
or
increase of
life as the
end.</div>

<p>3. The ethics of evolution&mdash;in whatever form we
have as yet found it&mdash;has always proceeded on the
assumption that life is desirable, and that it has
a value which makes its pursuit and promotion
a reasonable moral end. How this fundamental
ethical assumption<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> is to be justified, I do not at
present inquire. But the question must now be
faced&mdash;What is meant by "life" when we say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>that its "increase" or "development" is the moral
end, and speak of its "greatest totality" in a
way that implies that it admits of quantitative
measurement? <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Biological
definition of
life insufficient.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The biological definition of life is
itself matter of dispute. But, even were such a definition
as that proposed by Mr Spencer agreed to,
it would be insufficient to provide a standard for
human conduct. The very generality which may
make it fit to stand as a definition, or at least
abstract description, of life, renders it at the same
time incapable of serving as a criterion by which
the various modes of the manifestation of life may
be judged. One point, however, generally emphasised
by the theory of evolution, may be admitted.
The life which human conduct "ought" to increase
is not merely that of one individual man, but the
whole life of the community&mdash;"self, offspring, and
fellow-men"&mdash;with which the individual life is
bound up. Evolution has shown how the growth
of the individual has been so dependent upon that
of the whole body of society that it is impossible
to separate their interests. At the same time, no
complete identity has been brought about, and it
remains one of the greatest difficulties of any empirical
theory to harmonise their competing claims.
For argument's sake, however, and to admit of the
quality of the end being investigated apart from
considerations as to the method of distribution, the
question may be discussed as if natural selection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
had produced complete solidarity between the life
of the individual and that of the race.</p>

<p>What criterion have we, then, of the development
of human nature or life? The answer at once suggests
itself that the higher evolution of life can be
accurately measured by the amount of pleasure got
by living beings. But this view has been examined
in the preceding chapter, and found to be unsupported
by sufficient evidence; so that we are driven
to seek for some non-hedonistic criterion that will
give meaning to the phrase "development" or
"increase of life," when prescribed as the ethical
end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Health as
the end
either used
to interpret
pleasure,</div>

<p>Nor is the matter made any clearer by saying that
the "health" of society is the end we ought to promote.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
This has been put forward as an interpretation
of the hedonistic principle, which brings that
principle into accord with the theory of evolution.
As such, however, it seems open to fatal objections.
Given as an explanation of "pleasure," it falls back
upon the notion of "life"; for health can only be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>defined as that which conduces to continued and
energetic life. Further than this, there is a special
difficulty in adopting health as the proximate end
where pleasure is the ultimate end. Even if we
could assert that health always leads to pleasure, it
is not evident that it is better known, or more
easily made the end, than pleasure. For of present
pleasure we have a standard in our own consciousness
from which there is no appeal. And, although
the value of a series of pleasures is much harder to
estimate, there is also no slight difficulty in saying
what will promote the efficiency or health of an
organism. Besides, the question arises whether
health really corresponds with pleasure; and this
is, in another form, the question which has been
already answered in the negative,&mdash;whether life
can be measured by pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">or falls back
on the
notion of
life.</div>

<p>On the other hand, if "health" is to be taken
not as an explanation of or means to pleasure, but as
a substitute for the notion of "life," then we hardly
get beyond our original terms. "Health" must be
interpreted simply as that which leads to strong
and continued life: so that the only information to
be got from the new term is that the life we are to
promote must be vigorous and long; and this was
already implied in saying that it is the increase or
development of life that is the end. It will not do
to identify the notion with the mere balance of
physiological functions which, in common language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
appropriates to itself the term "health." We must
include the health of the soul as well as the health
of the body, and the health of society as well as the
health of the soul. The balance of mental and
social, as well as of physiological, functions, is implied
in the complex life of whose evolution we
form a part. To say that we are to promote this
balance of various functions, is to say nothing more
than that we are to promote the life into which
physical and mental and social factors enter. The
attempt to arrive at an end for conduct, by consideration
of the characteristics of evolution, has been
made without success. It has been found, too, that
"development" or "increase of life" does not admit
of translation into the language of hedonism: and
the question thus arises, how we are to define this
end, which we are unable to interpret in terms of
pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ways of
determining
increase of
life or natural
good,</div>

<p>What meaning can be given to the notion "increase
of life" as the end of conduct, without interpreting
life in terms of pleasure? Can we, the
question may be put, reach a "natural" good as distinct
from "sensible good" or pleasure? We must
discard at the outset any such "rational" view of
nature as gave colour to the Stoic doctrine by identifying
nature with the universal reason. And we
must equally avoid the doctrine that reason regulative
of conduct is manifested in the constitution of man
either in a distinct faculty, such as "conscience," or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in the due regulation of the various impulses. Trendelenburg's
teleological conception of human nature,
for instance, implies a rational element which
could not be got from the causal sequence traced by
evolution.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> For he determines the essence of man
by reference to the inner end of his constitution,
and postulates an organic unity of impulses which,
in the form of conscience, protests against self-seeking
action on the part of any single impulse.
But no other hierarchy of motives can be admitted
here than that produced by the natural law of evolution;
and this law can only show how one impulse,
or class of impulses, has become more authoritative,
by showing how it has become stronger or
more persistent: the other methods of evolving this
authority on the basis of naturalism, do so by means
of the pleasurable or painful consequences of motives
and actions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">either subjective
or
objective.</div>

<p>There are two ways in which, on most or all
ethical theories, the attempt may be made to distinguish
"good" from "bad" conduct. We may
either look to a subjective motive or impulse as
giving the means of distinction, or we may test
conduct by its conformity with an objective standard.
If we like to make use of the terms self-preservation
and self-development, then these may refer
either to the subjective impulse which urges man
to preserve or develop his life, or to some objective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>standard for estimating actions according as they
actually tend to prolong life or enrich it. Both
these possibilities are open to the theory of evolution.
Although the subjective impulse is, of course,
a property of the individual, it may be the result
of the whole course of social development, and thus
take in others as well as self in the range of its
application. It is therefore necessary to examine
both methods of determination with some care,
especially as we are in no little danger of reaching
an illusory appearance of conclusiveness by allowing
the subjective standard to rest on the objective,
and the objective, in turn, on the subjective.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) Subjective
standard:
most
persistent
impulses;</div>

<p>To begin with the subjective side. It may be
thought that we can point to some impulse, tendency,
motive, or class of motives in the individual mind by
following which the evolution of life will be promoted,
and that we are thus able to solve the question of
practical ethics, though our conception of what the
evolution of life connotes may still be in want of
exact definition. As already pointed out, such an
impulse (unless it depends on an objective standard)
must carry its own authority with it by its strength
or persistency. The case would, of course, be perfectly
simple, if we could assert that the carrying
out of all impulses in one's nature was to be approved
as tending to the development of life. Could
this assertion be made, there might be no difficulty
in ethics, or rather, there might be no ethics at all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
because there would be no difficulty in conduct. It
is obvious, however, that the development of one
natural tendency often conflicts with that of another
in the same individual, as well as with the tendencies
of other individuals. The course of evolution has
no doubt tended to modify, though it has not rooted
out, the impulses which are most prejudicial to individual
and social welfare. But the increase of
wants as well as satisfactions which it has brought
about in human nature, makes it doubtful whether
it has on the whole tended to diminish the conflict
of motives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">implies distinction
between
permanent
and
transient
self;</div>

<p>Again, when it is said that a man should "be
himself," or that this is his "strongest tendency,"<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
there is an implicit reference to a distinction between
a permanent and a transient, or a better and a worse
self, and it seems to be imagined that this distinction
can be reduced to difference in degrees of strength.
But evolution has not enabled us to obviate Butler's
objection to taking the "strongest tendency"&mdash;meaning
by this the tendency which is at any time
strongest&mdash;as representing "nature." For it is an
undeniable fact that the tendency which for a time
is the strongest&mdash;it may even be that which is
strongest throughout an individual life&mdash;frequently
leads to a diminution of vital power on the part of
the agent, as well as to interference with the free
exercise of the vital powers of others. Some advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>is gained, perhaps, by substituting for "strongest"
the nearly equivalent phrase "most persistent"
tendency. All those impulses which have in the
past served to promote life have been chosen out
and stored up as a sort of permanent basis for the
human fabric; whereas other impulses, not so advantageous
in their effects, have a less permanent
influence, though they are not less real. The more
regular or persistent class of impulses may, therefore,
(the idea is) be taken as representing the
course of the evolution by which they have been
produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but includes
non-moral
impulses in
the former,</div>

<p>To a large extent this distinction of two classes
of impulses is justified. There seems no doubt that
the social, and what are usually termed moral,
feelings have a tendency to return into consciousness
after any temporary depression or exclusion, which
is not shared by some of the feelings with which
they most commonly conflict. Other impulses, not
usually classed as moral, no doubt share this characteristic
of persistency or recurrence. "The wish
for another man's property," says Darwin, "is as
persistent a desire as any that can be named." The
selfish feelings have obviously this persistent character.
But an evolutionist may perhaps maintain
that it is one of the defects of ordinary moral opinion
that it depreciates the necessity and value for life
of the selfish feelings, just because they are so strong
as to stand in need of no encouragement. And it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
not necessary that the evolutionist morality should
agree at all points with ordinary moral opinion or
moral intuition. It recognises, or ought to recognise
the agency of immoral as well as moral forces, admitting
that it is by the action of both of these that
man as he is at present has been produced, although
the principle of the survival of the fittest has tended,
though by no means uniformly, towards the elimination
of the immoral factor. We may admit, therefore,
that there is a pressure on the will of the average
individual towards certain kinds of conduct rather
than others, or, put more precisely, that while all
acts are performed in consequence of pressure on
the will, the pressure towards certain kinds of acts
is a permanent force which, although overcome for
the time, always tends to reassert itself, while the
tendency towards other acts inconsistent with these
is more intermittent and variable, and does not reassert
itself in the same way. But this subjective
experience is so limited in accuracy and extent as
to be an unfit test of morality.</p>

<p>In the first place, selfish conduct is as necessary
for the preservation and development of man as
"altruistic" conduct, and must therefore have given
rise to an equally great and persistent pressure on
the will: so that the subjective criterion of persistency
leaves untouched what is often regarded as the
most difficult question of morals, the balance of social
and individual claims. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>is restricted
to previous
habits of
acting,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In the second place, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
subjective tendency is only a recurrence of antecedent
advantageous characteristics, and does not lead
us beyond the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</i>, so that, if any progress is to
be made in the future, it will be only possible through
the pressure of new external conditions: no function
is left for any ethical ideal which points beyond
past and present habits of action. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>and cannot
define
nature of
morality.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
In the third place,
subjective tendency only enables us to say generally
that some acts or tendencies are more persistent
than others, without giving any further description
of what sort of acts these are. Were these tendencies
or impulses a perfect guide to conduct, this
defect would be of little practical consequence. It
would prevent our having a definite ethical theory
only in circumstances in which no ethical theory
would be likely to be asked for. But the line between
the more and less persistent motives is a
narrow and shifting one. The impulses which are
the residua of advantageous ancestral actions are
counteracted by other impulses, residua of actions
which would not be counted as moral, though we
inherit tendencies to them because they formed a
real part of our ancestral activity. We therefore
stand in need of some characteristic by which to
distinguish the one class of tendencies from the
other. And as the only subjective characteristic is
that of strength or persistency, and this has been
found insufficient, an objective standard is shown
to be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thus subjective
standard
acknowledged
to
depend on</div>

<p>The impossibility of the subjective test doing
duty alone without support from some objective
criterion, is practically acknowledged by the writer
who has discussed this part of the subject with
greater penetration than any other investigator on
the same lines. "The average man," it is said,
"feels the pressure upon his own individual will
of all the unknown natural sequence of motive
which caused his ancestors to do on the whole
more often the right thing than the wrong"<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>&mdash;or,
as we must read it without objective assumption,
"to do on the whole more often one class of acts
than another." The right must be defined simply
as that to which this "special feeling in the subject
is directed," and it therefore becomes necessary
"to discover what descriptions of acts inspire this
feeling."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Thus, with greater facility than would
be permitted to a critic, we are made to pass
from the subjective to the objective method of
determination.</p>

But as by sensible good is meant pleasure,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and
pleasure is not the end, and as by moral good
is meant "the pursuit of natural good under difficulties,"<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
it follows that natural good is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>end we seek. We have thus to determine, as
exactly as may be, this objective standard called
natural good. It is interpreted in two ways, which,
however, may be "not necessarily inconsistent":
(α) "the perfection of the type as it is," and (β)
"the absolute abundance and variety of vital
power."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">(α) Conformity
to the
type.</div>

<p>This phrase, "the perfection of the type as
it is," is somewhat misleading. When "the perfection
of the type" is said to be the end, we
naturally regard the type as something that needs
to be brought to perfection, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex hypothesi</i> is not
perfect at present, or "as it is." But if "the perfection
of the type <em>as it is</em>" is the standard, this
implies, unless the standard itself is faulty, that
the type is already perfect, and, therefore, that the
perfection spoken of is the characteristic of a thing
which conforms to the type, and not something to
which the type has to conform. This interpretation
is confirmed by the fact that imperfection is
defined as "only departure from the class type."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
Plainly, then, the objective standard meant is conformity
to the type. What, then, is the type?
Concerning things made by art the answer is easy.
The type, as Mr Stephen puts it, represents the
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The type
defined as
what
best serves
its purpose<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
"maximum of efficiency,"<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> or, as we may say, is
that which most fully realises the purpose for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>which the thing was formed. The best bow is
that which shoots truest and farthest with a
relatively small expenditure of strength by the
archer; that which best realises the purpose of a
bow is the typical bow. A similar explanation of
types may be given regarding animals modified by
artificial selection. The typical pointer or hunter
can be defined from this teleological point of
view; and, as long as people lived in the belief
that all things were made for man, it was natural
to fix the type of each class by reference to the
human purpose it could best subserve. So also,
as long as people think that, whether all things
were made for man or not, all things may be
made use of by him, there will be a tendency
towards the same anthropomorphic interpretation
of types. If, then, the typical products of art, and,
to a large extent, the typical products of nature,
are those which best serve human purposes, or
best correspond with human ideals, how shall we
define the typical man himself&mdash;the type which
it is our perfection to conform to? "Every
reasoning agent," it may perhaps be allowed,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
"represents a certain type;" but the type can no
longer be defined merely as "maximum of efficiency,"
for it is the end or purpose of this efficiency
which now requires determination. In defining the
typical man, we must have no idea of final cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>or purpose which is not rooted in the nature of
his organism.</p>

<p>How, then, shall we now determine the type in
conformity to which perfection consists?<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">or as the
normal,</div>

<p>The first answer to this seems to be, that the
type is what is normal,&mdash;"what we have learned
to regard as the normal development of objects
belonging to" the class.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> But the normal may
have either of two meanings&mdash;it may, in the first
place, mean the usual or customary. This, however,
would make the typical man mean the ordinary
or average man; and the ideal of conformity
to the type would be reduced to doing the customary
thing, and not trying to be better than
one's neighbours. But it is evident that this stationary
morality does not represent properly what
is fundamental in the theory of evolution: "whatever
other duties men may acknowledge, they do
not look upon it as a duty to preserve the species
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in statu quo</i>."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> If natural science teaches one
thing more clearly than another, it is that the type,
like the individual, is not permanent, but the subject
of gradual modifications. If the type is what
is normal, we must mean by "normal" something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
else than customary. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>or as what
has strongest
vitality
or aids development,
that is,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
But the only other meaning
of the word seems to imply a reference to a rule&mdash;either
a rule imposed from without, or an inner
constitution or order. If the former alternative is
adopted, then we may use another definition of
Mr Stephen's, and say that "the typical organism
is ... that organism which is best fitted for
all the conditions of life, or, in other words,
which has the strongest vitality;"<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and thus
have to fall back either on the notion of "adaptation
to environment," or on that of "strongest
vitality"&mdash;the notion we are seeking to interpret.
If the other meaning, which the reference to a
rule may convey, be adopted, then we are met by
the fact that the inner order or constitution which
is to be our guide, can (from our present empirical
point of view) mean nothing different from the line
of development. And as we have already seen that
it is unsatisfactory to interpret this as equivalent
to adaptation to environment, or to increase of
definiteness, coherence, and heterogeneity, this principle
of conformity to the type is reduced to the
general principle which we have been attempting
to define more exactly&mdash;increase of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(β) Abundance
and
variety of
vital power,</div>

<p>Thus the first determination of natural good
as "perfection of the type" is seen to reduce
itself to the second, "absolute abundance and
variety of vital power." For the additional statement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>which makes the highest excellence consist
in "conformity to the type as it is going to be,
but as, except in a few chosen specimens, it is
not yet discernible to be,"<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> is unsatisfactory. For
to those "few chosen specimens" the end would
seem to be simply to remain as they are&mdash;a conclusion
which is hardly consistent for a writer
who regards morality as a continual progress towards
a higher life, a process of "climbing."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
And, for the generality of men, there must be
some standard for determining what is "going to
be," and for certifying that the "few chosen specimens"
have realised this state in its perfect form.
Thus "conformity to the type as it is going to be,"
equally with "perfection of [conformity to] the
type as it is," seems to be but another way of
saying "abundance and variety of vital power," or,
more fully stated, "the possession of abundant
faculties, active and passive, fully developed, and
in regular and equal exercise."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The question
thus comes to be how we are to determine this
"abundance of faculties." We cannot do so by
reference to such characteristics as increase in the
number and complexity of these faculties; for a
criterion of this kind, as we have seen, is of no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>assistance in deciding the most fundamental ethical
questions. To say that these faculties must be
"regular and equal" in their exercise, is to give
a merely formal canon. For how the equality
and regularity are to be brought about,&mdash;which
faculties are to be supreme and which subordinate&mdash;what
meaning equality can have in view of
the admitted diversity in a man's nature,&mdash;are
questions left altogether undetermined. And to
describe the ideal or perfect universe as one in
which there is no conflict or collision,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> is to give
a description which is negative as well as merely
formal. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>which falls
back on the
subjective
standard.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
We are thus obliged to fall back on
a subjective criterion, and say that the abundant
life which it is the end of conduct to promote
is a man's strongest tendencies, or the greatest
number of these. Natural good is determined by
"preferring out of all the rudimentary possibilities
existing in nature, the combination that harmonises
the greatest number of the strongest tendencies."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
We set out, be it remembered, to obtain a
characterisation of those acts to which the most
persistent tendencies of human nature lead us;
and the conclusion we have arrived at is, that they
are the acts which harmonise the greatest number
of the strongest tendencies. The objective standard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>is thus reduced to the subjective standard,
which it was brought in to explain and support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strongest
tendencies
the result
of past
activities,</div>

<p>Now these strongest tendencies, in the harmonious
play of which natural good or perfection is said
to consist, are themselves the result of the courses
of conduct which have been most vigorous and successful
in ancestral organisms, and they may therefore,
perhaps, be taken as a survival and index of
the antecedent state of human nature. The realisation&mdash;or,
rather, continuation&mdash;of human nature
as it has been and is, seems thus to be the ideal
which empirical evolution is able to set before
conduct,&mdash;with this formal modification, that, while
the various impulses are, so far as possible, to have
free play given them, they should be developed in
a harmonious manner. It seems doubtful how far
this tendency towards harmony is properly suggested
by, or consistent with, evolution, which has implied
a ceaseless struggle of opposing forces. At any
rate, evolution does not seem competent to give
any principle of relative subordination between the
various impulses, such as might add reality to the
formal principle of harmony. But what it is
essential to lay stress on here is, that the only
end which empirical evolution seems able to establish
is conformity to human nature as it is&mdash;the
tendencies in it which are strongest and most
persistent.</p>

<p>We thus see that the attempt to explain on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
empirical grounds what is meant by positing "life,"
or "increase and variety of life," as the end of
action, is practically reduced to making the most
persistent impulses of human nature the guide of
conduct. But these impulses, it has been shown,
are only the survival or remnant of past stages in
the course of development, not anticipations of
future stages: <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>and thus
give no ideal
for progress.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
so that evolution is in this way
incapable of giving an ideal of progress as the end
for conduct, and the last word it seems able to give
us as a guide for action is that we should tread in
the places where the footprints of ancestral conduct
have left the deepest impress. The ideal of such
a system is summed up in the new Beatitude,
"Blessed is he that continueth where he is." It
is probably just because the empirical aspect of
evolution seems so little able to yield an end for
human conduct corresponding to the actual course
of evolution&mdash;which has been progress&mdash;that no
thorough attempt has been made to develop a
system of morals from the principle just reached.
It is true that systems have been worked out by
moralists who have taken human nature as their
standard, and that Trendelenburg, at any rate,
expressly includes historical development in his
conception of man. But both Trendelenburg and
a moralist like Butler (who has as yet no conception
of the gradual modifications of human character
and tendencies produced by evolution) have a view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of human nature essentially distinct from that
which has been called the "naturalistic" view.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
For both assume a definite rational organisation of
impulses similar to that taught in Plato's analogy
between the individual man and a political constitution,
so that the whole nature, or human nature
as a whole, cannot be identified with the impulses
which strength at any time makes most persistent,
but depends upon the rational allotment of function
and measure to each.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>In summing up the argument of the preceding
chapters, it is necessary to refer again to the discussion
carried on in chapter vi. on the relation
between egoism and altruism as affected by the
theory of evolution. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Difficulty of
reconciling
individual
and social
ends.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
This discussion was not inserted
in order to throw an additional obstacle in
the way of obtaining an ethical end from the empirical
theory of evolution. It is an integral part
of an attempt to estimate the ethical value of the
evolution-theory. The antinomy between the individual
and social standpoints cannot be solved
by a theory of morality which does not recognise
that the individual, in his rational nature, is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>opposed to other individuals, but in reality one with
them. The theory of evolution certainly seems to
go a long way towards establishing the unity of the
individual with the race, and in substituting an
organic connection between them, in place of the
almost contingent reciprocal relations spoken of in
earlier empirical theories. But when we come to
inquire into this unity of organic connection, attempting
still to keep to the purely empirical point
of view, we find that the old difficulties return, that
it must be recognised that the connection is empirically
incomplete, and that it gives way at
the very places where a firm basis for the theory
of morals is required. It was in this way that,
quite apart from this opposition between the individual
and the whole, the empirical character
of the theory prevented our getting from it any
clear and consistent notion of the ethical end it
leads to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hedonistic
interpretation
of evolution
not
possible.</div>

<p>It appeared at first that the ethics of evolution,
when interpreted empirically, might be easily reconciled
with the older theory of hedonism, by
identifying life with pleasure&mdash;holding that the
highest or most evolved life is that which contains
most pleasure, and that increase of pleasure is
therefore the end of conduct. In this way the end
of evolutionism would be reduced to the end of
utilitarianism. Some utilitarians, on the other hand,
sought to get rid of the difficulties of their calculus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
by the assumption that the greatest pleasure would be
found by following the direction of evolution. But,
around both points of view, and the correspondence
they assumed to exist between pleasure and evolution,
special difficulties were seen to gather. Any
hedonistic theory might be met by the assertion
that life is essentially a painful experience, and
pleasure unattainable; and although the grounds
on which this assertion was made seemed to be
distinctly erroneous, and hedonism did not appear
to be an impossible theory of conduct, yet a similar
objection told with greater force against the combination
of evolutionism and hedonism. For it
holds the double position that the end is to promote
life, and that life is to be promoted by adding
to pleasure; or else, that the end is pleasure, but
that pleasure is to be got by following evolution.
It postulates, therefore, that the progress of life
tends, and tends even in a proportionate degree, to
the increase of pleasure. Yet we could obtain no
proof that this progress does, as a matter of fact,
increase pleasure in any regular way. On the contrary,
the facts of experience seemed to show that
life and pleasure do not advance proportionately,
nor even always concomitantly. But a still more
important and fundamental objection to the hedonistic
form of evolutionism was deduced from the
nature of pleasure itself; for it can be modified
indefinitely, and always follows in the wake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
function. Thus the sole intelligible account we
can give of what conduct will bring the greatest
pleasure is, that it is the conduct which calls forth
the greatest amount of successful energising, that
which employs the greatest number and the strongest
of the human faculties. Hence, instead of being
able to measure life by pleasure, we were driven to
interpret pleasure in terms of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No independent
ethical
ideal afforded
by the
theory of
evolution.</div>

<p>And perhaps at first sight it seemed that the
theory of evolution could lead us beyond the pleasure-basis
of older Naturalism. But, when the
matter was examined more closely, without departing
from the empirical point of view, it was found
that the notions put forward were unsatisfactory,
that they did not represent the progressive nature
of the course of evolution, and that their apparent
force fell away before logical analysis. It became
evident, in the first place, that no appropriate end
of human conduct could be derived from the nature
of evolution in general. It is true that adaptation
to environment is necessary for life; but to put forward
such adaptation as the end for action, is to set
up a practical goal which corresponds but ill with
the facts from which it professes to be taken, making
the theory which is supposed to account for
progress establish no end by pursuit of which progress
becomes possible for human action. Further
than this, it neglects a factor in evolution as necessary
to it as is adaptation to environment&mdash;the element,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
namely, of variation. A theory which took
the latter as well as the former of these factors into
account seemed, in the next place, to be given by
those general characteristics which are said to mark
all progress&mdash;increase of definiteness, coherence,
and heterogeneity. But from these, again, it was
found impossible to elicit a coherent and consistent
rule for determining right and wrong in conduct, or
a definite end for action: they were too abstract
and mechanical to suit the living organism of human
conduct; and we were thus driven back on the
more general statement that "life" or the "increase
of life" is the end after which we should strive.
In inquiring into the meaning which could be given
to this end, without interpreting it as pleasure, it
was found, after tracing it through various forms of
expression, that it reduced itself to making a man's
strongest and most persistent impulses both standard
and end. And this proved to be not only an
uncertain and shifting guide for conduct, but an
imperfect representation of what was to be expected
from a progressive, because evolutionist, ethics.
For these persistent impulses could only be regarded
as the survival of past activities, and consequently,
contained no ideal beyond that of continuing
in the old paths, and re-treading an already
well-beaten course. Just as from the external end
of adaptation to environment, so from this internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
or subjective principle, no ideal for progress, nor
any definite end of action, could be obtained.</p>

<p>It would appear, therefore, that the theory of
evolution&mdash;however great its achievements in
the realm of natural science&mdash;is almost resultless
in ethics. It only remains now to inquire whether
this want of competency to determine practical
ends may not be due to the superficiality of the
ordinary empirical interpretation of evolution, which
has hitherto been adhered to.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>ON THE BASIS OF ETHICS.</small></h2>


<p>The peculiarity of the conclusion we have reached
is, that the theory which is used to explain the
nature of progress, seems unable to give any canon
or end for conduct which points out the way for
progressive advance. The view of human nature
became unsatisfactory just at the critical point&mdash;when
we attempted to get at a knowledge of its end
or final cause, which would give unity and purpose
to action. To say that the end is increase of life
or function appeared a merely formal notion unless
we defined life as pleasure, while pleasure itself
was found to be unintelligible except as performance
of function. This uncertainty seems to indicate
a certain superficiality in the ordinary empirical
way of looking at evolution.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1. Principles
involved in
the theory of
evolution.</div>

<p>The principles involved in the theory of evolution
are, in brief, as follows. In the first place, it shows
that there is a tendency, brought about by natural
selection, for organisms to harmonise with or become
adapted to their environment&mdash;a tendency,
that is to say, towards unity of organism and environment,
and, in so far as external conditions are
uniform, towards a general unity of life. In the
second place, the theory implies variation in
organisms, produced either by the unequal incidence
of external forces, or by the spontaneous
action of the organism, or by both causes
combined. The mere increase in the number
of living organisms leads to a modification of the
conditions of life by which new variations are
encouraged. And this tendency to variation in
organisms&mdash;not merely the diversity of external
environment&mdash;is perpetually complicating the conditions
which the former tendency, that towards
unity, helps to bring into harmony. It thus happens
that there is, in the third place, a continual
process of readjustment and oscillation between
the tendency towards unity and that towards variety,
which, through opposition and conciliation,
produces continuity in nature. Each newly formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
unity between organism and environment is broken
by a new variation of the organism or of the environment,
which further complicates the problem to
be solved by the unifying process, and gives scope
for a more intricate and more comprehensive readjustment.
Unity, Variety, and Continuity are
thus the three principles implied in the theory of
evolution.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Unsuccessful
application
of these
principles
to ethics;</div>

<p>It is from these principles that the attempt has
been made to show the ethical bearing of evolution.
The first of them, Unity, is represented in the
theory that would make adaptation to environment
the end of conduct; and the second is represented
ethically in the doctrine suggested by Mr Spencer,
that the degree of morality depends on the degree
of complexity in act and motive. But both
of these views are obviously one-sided, even from
the point of view of empirical evolution. Taken
together, the principles on which they depend make
up that law of continuous and progressive advance
which may be regarded as expressing the essential
characteristic of the theory. And from this more
general and accurate expression of it, we might
have expected to have been able to elicit the contribution
which evolution has to make to the determination
of the ethical end. But after examining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>the various forms which it may take, we have
been unable to obtain from it a principle of action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) the principles
being
treated as
derived from
experience,</div>

<p>In inquiring into the reason which has made
the theory of evolution seemingly so barren in its
ethical consequences, the first point which requires
attention is that the characteristics of Unity, Variety,
and Continuity are treated by it not as principles
involved in development, but as theories inferred
from, or superinduced upon, the facts of
development. We are led by facts to suppose
certain hypothetical laws&mdash;namely, that organisms
tend to harmony with their environment, but that
there are certain causes promoting variation, and,
consequently, that the history of all life is that of
a continuous process towards more comprehensive
uniformities, passing always into more intricate
variations. Additional facts are compared with
these hypothetical causes, and, by their ability to
explain such facts, the hypotheses are raised to the
position of laws of nature, and are confidently applied
to account for new phenomena of the same
kind. But when we pass beyond facts lying immediately
on the plane of those from which our laws
have been gathered, it is to follow an insufficient
analogy if we interpret them by theories only shown
to belong to the former order. And this becomes
still more obvious when the change is not merely
to a different order of facts, but to a different way
of looking at facts, as is the case in the transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
from the point of view of knowledge to that of
action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">not as depending
on
a principle
implied in
experience;</div>

<p>But there is another way in which the principles
of Unity, Variety, and Continuity may be regarded.
Instead of being simply generalisations gathered
from experience and depending upon it, they may
be founded on a principle which is itself the basis
of the possibility of experience. Of course, no one
would think of denying that it is to the accumulated
mass of experienced facts that these laws owe their
prominence in modern scientific opinion, and their
acceptance by the judgment of the best scientists.
But the process by which a man has been led to lay
hold of such principles is one thing; their logical
position in relation to experience quite another.
Our definite recognition of the laws may very well
be the result of experience, at the same time that
the principle of Continuity is presupposed in our
having experience at all. As long as we kept to the
ground from which we started, and did not attempt
to get beyond the categories of causality and reciprocity,
our progress might seem to be easy enough.
Although their logical relations may be misconceived,
the laws are, of course, actually there, in experience:
their application to the successive phenomena of
nature remains the same, and may be duly apprehended.
The extension of facts into laws is explained
by the scientific imagination, and we do not
stay to inquire into the conditions on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
scientific imagination works and has applicability
to experience. But, when we try to pass from efficient
cause to the notion of purpose or of morality,
we find ourselves driven back on the fundamental
constitution of knowledge, and see that it is only
through the unifying and relating action of a self-conscious
subject that knowledge is possible or things
exist for us at all. And this is the reason why we
are able to say that the Unity or Continuity of
nature is a principle or law of experience.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Were
that principle not involved in knowledge, there
would be no world of nature for us at all. The
empirical interpretation of evolution, which has
been hitherto adopted, has made the negative side
of this truth sufficiently evident: it has shown that
we cannot, on empirical ground, reach the end or
purpose of human nature. The question thus arises,
whether what may be called the "metaphysical" or
"transcendental" interpretation of evolution can
show the reason of this defect and suggest a
remedy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) no logical
transition
being effected
from efficient
to
final cause.</div>

<p>The insufficiency of the empirical way of looking
at things is seen most clearly when we attempt
to make the transition just referred to, and
determine an end for conduct. It seems often to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>be thought that, in pointing out the tendency of
affairs, we are, at the same time, prescribing the
end towards which human endeavour ought to be
directed. Now, it is very difficult to say how far an
empirical method enables us to anticipate tendencies
of this kind at all. Even from the historical point
of view the conditioning circumstances are so complicated
that it is by no means easy to predict the
result of their combination. It is argued, however,
by Schäffle,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> that we are at least able to see as far
as the next stage in the series of historical progress,
and this is thought to lead to the conclusion that
we should make this next stage of development our
end: further than it we cannot see, and therefore
need not provide. If, then, we have no ultimate end
for conduct, at least we need never be without a
proximate end&mdash;and one which is always changing
with the course of events. Instead, therefore, of
saying that we should take no thought for the
morrow, the contention would seem to be that we
should live for the morrow but take no thought for
the day after. But here the altered point of view
is scarcely concealed. From the discussion of efficient
causes we proceed all at once to decide upon
ends or final causes. We have shown (let it be
granted) that, taking account of the present position
and mode of action of the forces we are able to
examine, they will modify the present state of affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>in a certain known manner. To-day we are in state
A; to-morrow we shall be in, or well on the way
towards, state Ab; therefore, runs the conclusion,
implied or expressed, we ought to make Ab our end.
But this is more than a fallacy due to the confusion
of the two meanings of "end." The conclusion to
which it leads is inconsistent with, or at least shows
the one-sidedness of, the premisses from which it was
drawn. For, if Ab is really the next term in the
series of historical progress, our making it our end
can neither help nor hinder its realisation. If, on
the other hand, there is really a meaning in our
making the world-end our own, then we cannot
bring that end, the realisation of which is conceived
as still in the future, under the category of efficient
causality, and say with confidence that it is the next
stage in the course of events.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Difference
between
causality
and teleology.</div>

<p>The idea does not work itself out in the same way
as an efficient cause works in the processes of nature.
We might indeed speak&mdash;perhaps with some intelligible
meaning&mdash;of the tendency of evolution becoming
conscious in man, and then working towards
its own realisation as a fixed idea. So far as the
simpler representations are concerned, this mode of
action has been clearly illustrated in Mr Bain's
writings; and the characteristic is not limited to
the less complex kinds of mental objects. The idea
is, in its own nature, a force tending both to exist
in consciousness and to realise itself through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
motor energies.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Consciousness of an end is a motive
to action. Thus the notion of final cause includes
that of efficient cause; but the two are not convertible.
The idea of an end, being conceived by reason,
cannot be described simply as a tendency become
conscious. It has passed into the region in which
various conceptions are, or may be, competing against
one another, and the resultant is decided on upon
grounds which may be called subjective since they
proceed from conscious determination. However
the laws of this conscious determination may be expressed,
they are not to be identified with the natural
sequence of events as it may be conceived to exist
independently of the individual consciousness. What
seems the tendency of things may be altered or
modified upon some ground of preference by the
conscious subject. In passing therefore to the working
out of a rational or mental idea&mdash;such as is implied
in the conception of an end&mdash;we can no longer
fully represent our notions by means of the determined
temporal succession called causality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">These notions
unconnected
by
empiricism,</div>

<p>Thus the empirical standpoint leaves the case
incomplete. A man might quite reasonably ask
why he should adopt as maxims of conduct the laws
seen to operate in nature. The end, in this way, is
not made to follow from the natural function of man.
It is simply a mode in which the events of the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>occur; and we must, therefore, give a reason why it
should be adopted as his end by the individual agent.
To him there may be no sufficient grounds of inducement
to become "a self-conscious agent in the evolution
of the universe." From the purely evolutionist
point of view, no definite attempt has been made
to solve the difficulty. It seems really to go no
deeper than Dr Johnson's reply to Boswell, when
the latter plagued him to give a reason for action:
"'Sir,' said he, in an animated tone, 'it is driving
on the system of life.'"<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> When any further answer
is attempted now to the question, it appears to
be on hedonistic grounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">even with
the assistance
of
hedonism.</div>

<p>But it is not certain that the next stage of
development will bring more pleasure along with
it than the present. Enough has already been
said of the difficulties and uncertainties which
surround any attempt to interpret evolution as
tending constantly to increased pleasure. It may
be thought, however, that, if neither optimism nor
pessimism is the conclusion to which we are led,
the modified doctrine of what is called Meliorism
may be accepted. And this theory&mdash;which holds
that the world is improving, that the balance of
good over evil, or that of pleasure over pain, is
on the increase&mdash;might seem to form a convenient
support to the present doctrine. For it may appear
to follow from it that, if the next stage in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>the world-process&mdash;that towards which evolution
is tending&mdash;is known, then we should make it
our end to accelerate this stage, as it will be one
which brings with it a better state of affairs than
the present. But not even the most enthusiastic
"meliorist" has tried to show anything more than
that his doctrine holds true in general, and that,
although progress has many receding waves, the
tide of human happiness is rising. But we cannot
tell how great these receding waves may be; nor
may we say that our action can have no power
to check them. It follows, therefore, that, in
judging of any special and temporary movement
of events (and it is not pretended that our anticipatory
knowledge of the future can extend far),
we cannot assume that the second stage will be
better than the first, or that voluntary modification
of it&mdash;if that be possible&mdash;might not improve
both the immediate result and its later consequences.
It becomes necessary, therefore, to compare
the value of the two by the directly pleasurable
effects they may be expected to have, so that we
are driven back to test the course of evolution
by reference to some other principle. The further
we go in examining an empirical theory, the clearer
does it become that it can make no nearer approach
to the discovery of an ethical end, than to point
out what courses of action are likely to be the
pleasantest, or what tendencies to action the strongest:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
while this can only be done within certain
limits. The doctrine of evolution itself, when
added to empirical morality, only widens our view
of the old landscape&mdash;does not enable us to pass
from "is" to "ought," or from efficient to final
cause, any more than the telescope can point
beyond the sphere of spatial quantity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New point
of view introduced
by
teleology</div>

<p>We are endeavouring to get at the idea or end
of human nature in an impossible way when we
attempt to reach it on purely empirical lines, and
think that, if we work long enough on them, we
are sure to come to it. In the same way it was
formerly thought by physiologists that, if we thoroughly
examined the brain with microscope and
scalpel, we should come upon the seat of the soul
at last, while psychologists were fain to believe
that, in addition to all our presentations of objects,
we had also a presentation of the subject or
thinking being. The mistake of both was in
imagining that the soul was a thing amongst other
things, or a presentation amongst other presentations,
instead of the subject and condition of there
being either things or thoughts at all. Of a similar
character is the attempt to get at an end or final
cause without leaving the point of view of efficient
causality. Were it successful, it would reduce final
cause to mechanism. To look upon man or upon
nature as manifesting an end implies an idea or
notion of the object as a whole, over and above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the mutual determination of its various parts, and
thus necessitates the contemplation of it "as though
an understanding contained the ground of the unity
of the multiplicity of its empirical laws."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> It is
the attempt to get at an external purpose for
objects of experience that has made teleology be
looked upon askance by men of science. A conception
of this kind went far to vitiate physics in
the middle ages, till it was, with justice, strictly
excluded from the scientific interpretation of nature
by the leaders of modern philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> But teleology
does not stand or fall with this external form
of it, which takes its illustrations from the products
of the factory, not from the manifestations of life,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
and which is really only mechanism misunderstood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">necessary in
considering
life,</div>

<p>The conception of an end is forced upon us in
considering life, because then it is necessary to take
account of the being as organised, and therefore as
a whole. In the investigation of nature, on the
other hand, things may be apprehended without
relation to the conception of the whole; and teleology,
therefore, seems to be unnecessary. The
notion of purpose, it is often said, is essential
to biology, but out of place in physical science.
But when we look on the world as a whole, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>notion of end or purpose is introduced, and the
functions of its various parts conceived from a new
point of view. And the end of an organism can
only be partially understood, when that organism
is conceived as a whole apart from its environment.
It is only a partial manifestation or example of the
more perfect reality in which things are to be
regarded as not merely conditioned and conditioning,
but as revelations of purpose. But, although
the notion of purpose cannot be dispensed with in
considering organic nature, the teleological notions
we form of living things are imperfect and "abstract."
Thus the organism is often, more or less
explicitly, judged by its utility for some human
purpose. In these cases the end is clearly an
external and dependent one. And, when the
adaptation of its parts is spoken of in relation to
its type or perfect form, a conception is involved
over and above what can be inferred from the
nature of the organism in itself. The notion of the
end depends upon a rational ideal, which passes
beyond the causal interrelation of parts to the
conception of the organism as a whole, whose
function is necessarily related to its environment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and life
directly
known only
as self-conscious.</div>

<p>Our knowledge of the ends of the lower animals
is really much more imperfect than our knowledge
of the human end. For the only life we really
know is self-conscious life, and that we are unable
to attribute to them. We know their life only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
by conjecture, our knowledge of it being but an
abstraction from our own consciousness. The
ethical, as Trendelenburg puts it,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> is the higher
stage of the process, a lower stage of which is the
organic. The purpose, which is conceived as blind
or unconscious in nature, becomes conscious and
voluntary in man. But our notion of the former
is simply an abstraction from the free and conscious
purpose which characterises our own activity.
The conception of life is only known to us as&mdash;is
only&mdash;an element or moment in our own self-consciousness.
And life which is not self-conscious
can only be judged in relation to the self-consciousness
which contains in itself the explanation
both of life and of nature. The germ of truth
in the old mechanical teleology may perhaps be
seen in this way. For it had right on its side in
so far as it referred everything to the self-consciousness
manifested in man; it was mistaken
only in so far as it made things relative to his
needs and desires. The teleological anthropomorphism
which judges all things according to their
correspondence with human purposes, must be transcended,
equally with the speculative anthropomorphism
which frames the unseen world in the
likeness of the phenomena of our present experience.
But to attempt to escape from what is sometimes
called anthropomorphism&mdash;the reference of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>the nature and purpose of things to self-consciousness,
as expressive of the ultimate reality&mdash;is to
attempt to escape from thought itself, and makes
one's thinking from the beginning void and contradictory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Reference
to self-consciousness
implied in
evolution,</div>

<p>Now this reference to self has been omitted in
our consideration of empirical evolution. We have
taken the purely objective ground of science, and
we have admitted what science has told us of how
all sorts of things came to be,&mdash;how man appeared
on the earth, gradually adapted himself to his surroundings
and modified them&mdash;how sentiments expanded,
customs grew, and one institution developed
out of another. But science shows us all this only
as an external process of events in space and time&mdash;a
process in which the preceding determines each
succeeding state, and all parts are united together.
It does not show us the process from the inside.
And, in the end, it can do no more than point towards,
without reaching, the comprehensive idea of
a whole, by reference to which idea all the members
of the whole are determined, in such a way that it
is insufficient to look upon one as causing another,
and with the others making up the aggregate; since
each member only exists for the sake of the whole,
and the idea of the whole precedes the parts which
constitute it.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The teleological conception thus
necessarily leads us beyond the ordinary categories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>of science, by which all things are conceived as connected
causally in space and time. But the scientific
theories that we have been discussing do not
recognise this altered point of view; and, without
giving any justification for the change of standpoint,
lay down the moral law that we ought to
aim at the realisation of something which can only
be described as a mental conception or idea. Here
a double change in point of view is involved. We
are no longer considering a process going on outside
us, in which the reference to self may be fairly
ignored, but we put ourselves in relation to this
external order: and we do so, not merely as cognitive,
but as active&mdash;as the potential source of actions
which we say "ought" to be performed by us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) made
clear in the
attempt to
trace the
genesis of
self-consciousness.</div>

<p>The assumption involved in the former change is
that made by comparative or evolutionist psychology,
when it attempts to play the part of a theory
of knowledge. The development of impressions
and ideas is made to pass upwards to more complicated
stages, till it reaches the point at which the
individual, conceived as determined by external
forces and reacting upon them, becomes conscious
of itself as a subject of knowledge and source of
action. This transition from the category of causality
to self-consciousness is, in some systems&mdash;that
of Mr Spencer, for example&mdash;either concealed
or held to with no firm grasp. Throughout his
objective treatment of psychology, it would seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
that Mr Spencer is evolving mind or self-consciousness
out of the process in which simple relations of
matter and motion form the lowest stage, and reflex
action is that which approaches most nearly to having
mental characteristics. And, from this objective
point of view, he speaks of his philosophy as an
interpretation of "the detailed phenomena of life,
mind, and society, in terms of matter, motion, and
force."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> But when he discusses the subjective side,
he admits that it is entirely unique and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
and adopts what is known as the "two aspects"
theory&mdash;the theory that mind cannot be accounted
for as derived from matter, any more than matter
can be accounted for as derived from mind, but that
they are both phases of one ultimate and unknown
reality.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> This admission involves a practical acknowledgment
that it is impossible to arrive at consciousness
or at subjectivity by a process of natural development.
We must, it affirms, postulate two aspects
or phases of existence, or two lines of development,
connected probably in their ultimate reality, but, as
known to us, distinct from one another, and without
mutual influence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reference
to self-consciousness,</div>

<p>The doctrine that a reference to self-consciousness
is implied in experience, may perhaps be made
clearer by considering a criticism to which it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>recently been subjected by an able psychological
writer. Professor W. James writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The doctrine of the post-Kantians, that all knowledge is
also self-knowledge, seems to flow from this confusion [between
the psychologist's standpoint and the standpoint of
the feeling upon which he is supposed to be making his report].
Empirically, of course, an awareness of self accompanies
most of our thinking. But that it should be needed
to make that thinking 'objective' is quite another matter.
'Green-after-red-and-other-than-it' is an absolutely complete
object of thought, ideally considered, and needs no added
element. The fallacy seems to arise from some such reflection
as this, that since the feeling <em>is</em> what it feels itself to be,
so it must feel itself to be what it <em>is</em>&mdash;namely, related to each
of its objects. That the last <em>is</em> covers much more ground
than the first, the philosopher here does not notice. The
first <em>is</em> signifies only the feeling's inward quality; the last <em>is</em>
covers all possible facts <em>about</em> the feeling,&mdash;relational facts,
which can only be known from outside points of view, like
that of the philosopher himself."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now it seems to me that the real confusion here
is between the point of view of experience, and the
point of view of reflection on experience, and that it
is not the "post-Kantians" who confuse the two
points of view. The "post-Kantians"&mdash;by whom
Professor James means T. H. Green and the
writers commonly associated with him&mdash;habitually
occupy the latter standpoint. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>though not
itself a part
of experience,<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
They do not
hold that "all knowledge is also self-knowledge," in
the sense that "an awareness of self accompanies
most [or all] of our thinking." When we have this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>empirical "awareness of self," our object is the
more or less distinct contents of perception, &amp;c.,
which make up the empirical ego. But this knowledge
of the empirical ego, equally with knowledge
of external nature, <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>logically
implied by
experience.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
implies logically the action of
self-consciousness. When we reflect upon experience,
one constant element is seen to be implied in
it&mdash;the reference to a subject of knowledge and
feeling. Certainly "post-Kantians" do not imagine&mdash;as
Professor James seems himself to imagine and
to think they do&mdash;that a feeling feels itself, or an
object knows itself. "Green-after-red-and-other-than-it"
is for them, as for him, if not "an absolutely
complete object of thought," yet relatively
complete. It may be apprehended alone as a part
of experience. But reflection on experience shows
that it, like any other object of thought, depends
upon a knowing subject. The "post-Kantians" do
not assert that knowing an object involves for the
individual knower actual consciousness of what his
knowledge implies, any more than they would say
that the "plain man" is already a metaphysician.
But they hold that reflection on experience shows
that self-reference, or reference to a subject, is a
logical condition of there being experience at all.
So far from confusing the two standpoints, they
require carefully to emphasise their difference, lest
the actual content of a state of consciousness in the
individual man be held to be equivalent to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
grounds or conditions of that state of consciousness.</p>

<p>The reason why there is even an apparent plausibility
in the attempt to get at a natural development
of self-consciousness, is that the reference to
self is, from the outset, implicitly, but logically,
assumed in tracing the sequence of events which
forms the subject-matter of the theory of evolution,
while the course of development does nothing more
than render its implication explicit. Self-consciousness
is not something that exists apart from the
world of known and knowable objects, any more
than it is itself a special department of this world
of objects distinguishable from, and determined by,
its surroundings. It is, on the contrary, the supreme
condition of the world of objects having any existence
whatever. It is only through objects being
brought into relation with the identical and permanent
subject of knowledge, that there is unity in
nature, or, in other words, that there is a known
world of nature or experience at all. The evolution
of mind or self-consciousness out of experience is,
therefore, not merely to be rejected as a problem
too intricate for psychological analysis. It is a
mistake to think that it is a possible problem at all;
for it attempts to make experience account for and
originate the principles on which its own possibility
depends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) made
clear in the
attempt to
trace morality
from
reflex action.</div>

<p>But it is the second change in point of view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
which needs special emphasis here&mdash;the change
from the point of view of science to that of morality.
Taken in its bare form, this is perhaps little
more than a confusion of thought. The fact of
things being of a certain constitution, and of their
progress tending in a certain direction, cannot of
itself supply a law for the exercise of our activity.
But the view is associated with a theory of the
nature of human action which seeks to bring it into
the strict line of natural development. Just as
empirical psychology attempted to treat self-consciousness
as a stage in the evolution of experience
or knowledge, so the empirical theory of morality,
aided by the doctrine of evolution, tries to show
how the action which is called moral has been developed
out of purely physical or reflex action. But
this theory of the development of moral action is
really open to the same objection as that which was
urged against the theory which evolves self-consciousness
from the unconscious. The objection to
the latter was, that experience, itself constituted by
consciousness, is made to produce the condition of
its own possibility; and a similar confusion is involved
in attempting to develop moral action out of
merely physical or reflex action. The only case of
true psychical or conscious action is that in which
there is a conscious determination of end and means;
and action of this kind implies the same relation to
self-consciousness as that by which knowledge is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
constituted. The relation is, however, manifested
in a different way: it is not an apprehension of the
manifold of impression into the unity of consciousness,
but the externalisation of self-consciousness
in realising a conceived end or idea. Now, in so
far as physical and psychical facts are phenomena
of experience&mdash;and they have no other existence, at
least none that can have any intelligible meaning
given to it&mdash;they presuppose self-consciousness; for
it is only in relation to it that experience is possible.
That is to say, their existence logically implies
a reference to a subject whose active externalising
manifestation is the determination of means
and end which constitutes moral (as distinguished
from merely natural) action. So far, therefore,
from our being able to trace the development of
moral action from the simpler phenomena of natural
action, we find that these, in their most rudimentary
form, by virtue of their being phenomena of
experience, imply and receive their reality from
the self-consciousness which is the differentiating
quality both of knowledge and of moral action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. The unity
of self-consciousness:</div>

<p>From this it follows that, although, empirically,
the change from the point of view of science to that
of morality is a transition to a different order of
facts, yet the passage may be possible transcendentally
through self-consciousness. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>(<i>a</i>) as making
possible
the transition
from
knowledge
to morality;<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
For in self-consciousness
we reach the element of identity between
knowledge and action. It is, therefore, of importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
to understand the nature of this self-conscious
activity in relation to knowledge and to action. If
the fundamental characteristic of knowledge is the
bringing into relation to consciousness, then all
conscious action has this characteristic; for it determines
self towards some particular line of activity&mdash;that
is to say, towards an object or end which
is thereby related to consciousness. Action therefore,
we may say, is knowledge. And in the same
way, on the other hand, since the relating to consciousness
which constitutes knowledge can only be
regarded as originated by the subject, it follows,
conversely, that knowledge is action.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> "We act,"
says Spinoza, "only in so far as we know or understand."
Action is but one aspect or manifestation
of that which, in another aspect or manifestation, is
knowledge. But the aspect of self-consciousness
we call knowledge and that we call action are different
from one another. In the former the relating
to consciousness in the definite forms of thought
and perception is the prominent thing. In the latter
it is the realising energy of the self-conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>subject. The ordinary distinction between knowledge
and action is therefore correct, if not pushed
to the extent of making an absolute separation
between them: in the former we idealise the real,
in the latter we realise the ideal. But they are at
one in this, that both involve self-conscious activity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>b</i>) as determining
the
character of
the ethical
end,</div>

<p>The self-consciousness which in one relation is
knowledge, in another action, is thus the fundamental
fact of human nature; and on it, therefore, the
ethical end must be based, if that end can be disclosed
by the nature of man, and is to express what
is most fundamental in his nature. Now, as knowledge
finds its completion when all things are connected
with one another and the subject in a definite
system of relations, the end of completed self-conscious
activity cannot be different. In their
final perfection, as in their fundamental nature,
the two are at one. As Kant puts it,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> the speculative
and the practical reason are reconciled in the
notion of end. However virtue may differ from
knowledge in the processes of ordinary experience,
the distinction only belongs to their finite realisation.
An intuitive understanding, or understanding
which, in knowing, creates the objects of knowledge,
is the highest conception of reason. Yet the
very notion of a finite self implies that neither
such knowledge nor such activity belongs to it. In
knowledge and action, as properties of the ultimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>self-consciousness, human beings only participate.
It is only by means of the laborious methods of
observation and inference that they approach the
intuition of all things as a unity in which perfect
knowledge consists; and, in the same way, it is
only by the gradual volitional adaptation of means
to end that they are able, in some measure, to contribute
to the realisation of self-consciousness in the
world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">as self-realisation,</div>

<p>An end can only be made our own when conceived
as necessary for realising or completing our
idea of self. Conscious volition only follows a
conceived want, or recognition that the self as
imagined&mdash;the ideal self&mdash;is not realised in the
actual self. The action is towards a fuller working
out of the idea of self; and the end may therefore,
in all cases of conscious action, be said to be self-realisation,
though the nature of this end differs
according to each man's conception of self. This
may be expressed, as Green expresses it, by saying
that "self-satisfaction is the form of every object
willed; but ... it is on the specific difference
of the objects willed under the general form of
self-satisfaction that the quality of the will must
depend."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> It appears to me, however, that this
statement requires to be guarded by an explanation.
The self-satisfaction sought must not be looked
upon as a feeling,&mdash;for if it is, it can only be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>interpreted psychologically as pleasure&mdash;but as
simply conscious self-realisation. And this self-realisation
is the objective consciousness of an
attained end, which is accompanied by, but is not
the same as, the feeling of pleasure. Self-realisation
is the end, not the pleasurable feeling which
follows it; self-satisfaction, not the "pleasure of
self-satisfaction." In this way, the common experience
"that the objects with which we seek
to satisfy ourselves do not turn out capable of
satisfying us,"<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> might be expressed by saying that
the method adopted for the realisation of self is
often found in its result to lead to incomplete, or
even to illusory, self-realisation.</p>

<p>The question thus arises, What is the true self
that is to be realised, and what is meant by the
realisation of it? The will that wills itself is as
bare a notion in ethics, as the thought that thinks
itself is in metaphysics. The "good will," which
Kant rightly held to be the only ultimate good,
never altogether escaped this formality in Kant's
own treatment of it. His idea of humanity as a
realm of ends was limited by his formal conception
of the function of reason, though it suggests the
way by which the mere tautology of will may be
transcended. It is of the essence of a finite will
that its end is different from the realisation of the
end. But the rationality of the will implies that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
must aim at nothing less than the harmonious articulation
of its whole activity in the unity of self-consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but as transcending
egoism;</div>

<p>It has been argued above that both knowledge
and morality are expressions of self-conscious
activity: in it these different manifestations find
an element of fundamental identity. But it may
be maintained, further, that this "unity of self-consciousness"
is not merely the unity of the
different states of an individual, but that it is an
element which transcends the difference by which
concrete individuals are distinguished from one
another. If this view can be carried out, it seems
to lead us to attribute to other men something more
than a "similar consciousness"<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
to our own, and
to make us look on all self-conscious beings as
sharing in, or manifesting, in various imperfect
ways, one identical self-consciousness. From this
point of view, self-realisation would be established
as no mere individual end. The first law of morality
would be not the "natural" impulse for each to
take care of himself in the struggle for life, but,
on the contrary, the sublation of that distinction
between the particular ego and other individuals
which would admit of the one using the others
as mere means to his own advancement. His true
end is the same as theirs: the realisation of the
self-consciousness in which both partake&mdash;its realisation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>that is to say, not in one individual only, but
wherever it is manifested.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
This is the rationale
of what the empirical theory of evolution tries to
establish by pointing to the growing harmony in
feeling and interest between the individual and
society. What evolution really shows is the gradual
manifestation in actual volition of the identity of
nature in all men.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
I do not say that this fundamental
identity of nature does away with all conflict
between self-realisation in one's self and in others;
but it does much, if it establishes the principle that
the realisation of one's own nature involves the
realisation of that of others. As Schäffle says,
"the moral law is the direction of the will to the
genuinely human as humanity;" and "this is a
transcendental element embedded in the hearts of
all men&mdash;though in its basis only, for it is developed
and ripened in the course of history."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
And the
more fully self-consciousness is realised, the clearer
does it become that its complete realisation implies
that "kingdom of ends" spoken of by Kant, in
which all self-conscious beings are at once subjects
and sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">(<i>c</i>) as showing
that the
realisation
of the end
must be
progressive.</div>

<p>Further, self-realisation in both its aspects&mdash;as
individual and as social&mdash;is necessarily progressive.
It is only at the highest stage of its development
that nature becomes the organ of intelligence and
morality.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> And, just as knowledge expresses
itself through the forms of space and time, and,
therefore, by gradual colligations of facts, so the
conscious determination of activity is manifested
in the world in an order of consecutive acts, and is
therefore subject, in its manifestation, to the laws
of temporal succession. It is the part of a system
of metaphysics&mdash;at any rate, it does not belong to
the present inquiry&mdash;to show how reason manifests
itself in space and time, and how, through the
rationality of this manifestation, everything in
space is and acts only in relation to its environment,
and through it, to the rest of the world, and
how each event in time is the result of preceding
events, and determines those which follow it.
What it thus shows the necessity of is the process
of evolution; and it is because this process is determined
by reason that the world is the object of
knowledge and the sphere of moral action. Evolution
is thus not the foundation of morality, but the
manifestation of the principle on which it depends.
Morality cannot be explained by means of its own
development, without reference to the self-consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>which makes that development possible.
However valuable may be the information we get
from experience as to the gradual evolution of
conduct, its nature and end can only be explained
by a principle that transcends experience.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The difference between Aristotle and Kant in ethics is sometimes
expressed (see Trendelenburg, Hist. Beiträge zur Phil.,
iii. 171 ff.) as if it consisted in the fact that the former investigated
human nature in order to find its <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">τέλος</span> (~telos~), whereas the
latter sought the standard of action in a transcendental ground.
There is reason for this distinction in Kant's manner of statement.
But both may be regarded as investigating human nature.
Their difference rather consists in the different position and function
assigned to reason in man. It is because Kant is for the
moment looking upon reason as something distinct from human
nature that he says that "the ground of obligation is to be sought,
not in the nature of man or in the circumstances in the world in
which he is placed, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i> simply in the notions of pure
reason" (Werke, iv. 237). His "metaphysical" view of ethics,
however, follows from the rational constitution of the human
subject and his experience, and does not depend on any source
that really "transcends" the reason of man.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Thus, according to James Mill, "the terms 'idea of pleasure'
and 'desire' are but two names; the thing named, the state of
consciousness is one and the same. The word Desire is commonly
used to mark the idea of a pleasurable sensation when the
future is associated with it."&mdash;Analysis of the Phenomena of the
Human Mind, J. S. Mill's edit., ii. 192; cf. Fragment on Mackintosh
(1835), p. 389 f. To the same effect J. S. Mill says:
"Desiring a thing and finding it pleasant, aversion to it and
thinking of it as painful, are phenomena entirely inseparable, or
rather two parts of the same phenomenon; in strictness of language,
two different modes of naming the same psychological fact."&mdash;Utilitarianism,
7th ed., p. 58.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> "Will is the child of desire, and passes out of the dominion

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Thus Jonathan Edwards says: "When I say that the Will is
as the greatest apparent good, or (as I have explained it) that
volition has always for its object the thing which appears most
agreeable, it must be carefully observed, to avoid confusion and
needless objection, that I speak of the <em>direct</em> and immediate
object of the act of volition, and not some object to which the
act of will has only an indirect and remote respect."&mdash;On the
Freedom of the Will, part i. § 2; Works, i. 133. The matter
is put still more clearly by the late Alfred Barratt: "Action
does not always follow knowledge. Of course not: but the doctrine
[Hedonism] does not require that it should; for it says, not
that we follow what <em>is</em> our greatest possible pleasure, or what we
know or 'think' to be so, but what at the moment of action
is most desired."&mdash;Mind, vol. ii. 173; cf. Physical Ethics, p. 52 ff.
So Mr Stephen, Science of Ethics, p. 47: "It is more accurate
to say that my conduct is determined by the pleasantest judgment,
than to say that it is determined by my judgment of what
is pleasantest." The negative side of the same view was expressed
by Locke in his doctrine that action is moved by the
most pressing uneasiness (Essay, II. xxi. 29, 31), and distinguished
by him from the former view (b), that the "greater visible good"
is the motive (II. xxi. 35, 44).</p></div>

predecessors, first, legal duty, or that the contravention of which
is punished by the ministers of the state; secondly, moral duty,
enforced by the unofficial punishment of social disapprobation;
and thirdly, the conduct which society leaves to individual choice,
without censuring either its commission or omission. Moral duty
is further distinguished by him from the meritorious, or conduct
which society encourages by approval, without censuring its
omission.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Mr Gurney's attempt (Mind, vii. 349 ff.) to rationalise
the utilitarian "ought" depends upon the assumption that the
individual feels a desire (not only for his own, but) for other
people's pleasure (p. 352). From the point of view of the psychological
hedonist, however, this desire is only secondary and
derivative, depending upon the fact that it increases the pleasure
of the subject. "Your pleasure," the psychological hedonist
would say, "is desired by me <i>quâ</i> my pleasure." If, on the other
hand, it is admitted that the individual has other ends than his
own pleasure, there seems no ground in psychological fact for
limiting these ends to something aimed at because pleasurable to
others. From this point of view the first step in the establishment
of an ethical theory would be an attempt to find a principle
of unity in the various ends actually aimed at by individuals, and
recognised by them as "good." This is made by Professor Sidgwick,
who, while allowing that "it is possible to hold that the
objective relations of conscious minds which we call cognition of
Truth, contemplation of Beauty, Freedom of action, &amp;c., are good,
independently of the pleasures that we derive from them," maintains
that "we can only justify to ourselves the importance that we
attach to any of these objects by considering its conduciveness, in
one way or another, to the happiness of conscious (or sentient)
beings" (Methods of Ethics, iii. xiv. 3, 3d ed., p. 398). But
Mr Sidgwick's Utilitarianism depends on a Rational view of
human nature which is beyond the scope of the present discussion.

Bain says (Emotions, p. 276 n.), "we ought to have a written

loosely written moral treatise, but a strict enumeration of what
society requires under pain of punishment by excommunication
or otherwise,&mdash;the genuine offences that are not passed over."
This would certainly be very desirable, were it not from the
nature of the case impracticable. Popular judgment as to a
man's conduct,&mdash;what society imposes,&mdash;is one of the things most
difficult to predict: it is under the influence of most heterogeneous
causes, personal, industrial, religious, political, &amp;c. I do
not think, for instance, that any one could safely undertake to
describe exactly the kind of actions which will infallibly call forth
the censure of British public opinion, or that of the smaller and
intersecting groups into which society is divided.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> The ambiguity of the phrase is explained in an interesting
way in Sir H. Maine's account of the change from its juridical to
a political or ethical meaning. In some writers it seems to have
a third and still different signification. We must thus distinguish
(1) the juridical meaning, originating in the Roman "law common
to all nations," which had arisen through the "constant <i>levelling</i>
or removal of irregularities which went on wherever the prætorian
system was applied to the cases of foreign litigants," modified
subsequently by the Greek conception of <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ἰσότης</span> (~isotês~). (2) The
political meaning, that all men ought to be equal, arose from
the preceding. But its notion of "ought" seems often to depend
on an idea of the constitution of nature according to which all
men are actually born equal&mdash;not only in rights, soon to be
obscured by human convention, but also in power or faculty,
afterwards unequally developed by education. Hence (3) the
natural meaning. The doctrines of evolution and heredity have
made this view seem as strange to us now as it would have done
to the Romans from whom it was illegitimately derived. Yet at
one time it seems to have been assumed, almost without question,
that there is but little difference in the natural endowments of
different men. This assumption lay at the basis of Hobbes's
political theory&mdash;Leviathan, I. xiii. p. 60,&mdash;was stated in a more
guarded form by Locke&mdash;On Education, § 1; Works, ed. of
1824, i. 6,&mdash;and adopted almost without qualification by Helvétius,
who, carrying out Locke's metaphor of the soul as, at
birth, a "tabula rasa," afterwards written over with the pen of
experience, says: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quintilien, Locke, et moi, disons: L'inégalité
des esprits est l'effet d'une cause connue, et cette cause est la
différence de l'éducation</span>"&mdash;the causes of the existing inequality
being afterwards stated as twofold: first, the difference of environment,
which may be called chance; and secondly, the difference
of strength in the desire for instruction.&mdash;De l'homme, II. i., III.
i., IV. xxii.; Œuvres, ii. 71, 91, 280. (Quintilian's statement,
however, is even more guarded than Locke's. Cf. Opera, ed.
Spalding, i. 47.)</p></div>

in his Practical Essays (1884), p. 155: "'How is society to be
held together?' is the first consideration; and the sociologist&mdash;as
constitution-builder, administrator, judge&mdash;is the person to
grapple with the problem. It is with him that law, obligation,
right, command, obedience, sanction, have their origin and their
explanation. Ethics is an important supplement to social or
political law. But it is still a department of law. In any other
view it is a maze, a mystery, a hopeless embroilment."</p></div>

who holds that the "pleasure of malevolence" is not only a real
element in the human constitution, but greater than would be
naturally called forth by the conditions and course of development.
"It is remarked by Mr Spencer," he says, "that it was
necessary for the progress of the race that destructive activity
should not be painful, but on the whole pleasurable. In point of
fact, however, the pleasure of destruction has gone much beyond
what these words express, and much beyond what is advantageous
to the collective interest of animals and of human beings alike.
The positive delight in suffering has been at all stages too great."&mdash;The
Emotions and the Will, p. 66. So far from adopting this
argument, however, I must confess myself still amongst the unconvinced
regarding the "pleasure of malevolence."</p></div>

of function" or "life" as the end of conduct, may be
illustrated by the following passage from Mr Pater's 'Marius
the Epicurean' (1885, i. 163): "Really, to the phase of reflection
through which Marius was then passing, the charge of
'hedonism,' whatever its real weight might be, was not properly
applicable at all. Not pleasure, but fulness of life, and 'insight'
as conducting to that fulness&mdash;energy, choice and variety of
experience&mdash;including noble pain and sorrow even&mdash;loves such as
those in the exquisite old story of Apuleius; such sincere and
strenuous forms of the moral life, as Seneca and Epictetus&mdash;whatever
form of human life, in short, was impassioned and
ideal: it was from this that the 'new Cyrenaicism' of Marius
took its criterion of values. It was a theory, indeed, which
might rightly be regarded as in a great degree coincident with
the main principle of the Stoics themselves, and a version of the
precept 'Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy
might'&mdash;a doctrine so widely applicable among the nobler spirits
of that time; and as with that its mistaken tendency would lie
in the direction of a kind of idolatry of mere life, or natural gift
or strength&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'idolâtrie des talents</i>."</p></div>

In his popular essay, 'Grundzüge der Moral' (1883), Dr Giźycki's
principle and method are utilitarian. With the above may be
compared Guyau, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esquisse d'une morale sans obligation ni sanction
(1885), p. 15: "L'action sort naturellement du fonctionnement de
la vie, en grande partie inconscient; elle entre aussitôt dans le
domaine de la conscience et de la jouissance, mais elle n'en vient
pas. La tendance de l'être à persévérer dans l'être est le fond de

is true if the naked law of duty&mdash;or respect for it&mdash;is the sole
ethical motive. But if morality consists in the attainment of
an ideal which is being gradually realised in man, moral value
will not be denied to the motive which leads the individual to
fashion his own nature after that in which morality has attained
more complete realisation.</p></div>

103 ff. Wundt, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Physiologische Psychologie</span>, 2d ed., p. 469, finds
in this an instance of Weber's law. Thus, the man with £100
receives the same pleasure on receipt of £1, as the possessor of
£1000 does on receiving £10. As Wundt remarks, however, this
is only true within certain limits. Sixpence may give more
pleasure to a beggar who is never far from the starvation-point,
than the clearing of a million to Baron Rothschild. Further than
this, the law only states an "abstract" truth. For the susceptibility
to pleasure is not only very different in different individuals,
but this difference depends on many other circumstances than the
amount of wealth already in possession,&mdash;such as original emotional
susceptibility, &amp;c.</p></div>

den anderen (es gibt keine eigenen 'Gefühlsvorstellungen'), ja

different, but does not altogether prevent him from acknowledging
the subjectivity of feeling: "Without intellectual images
clearly recollected, we do not remember feelings; the reproduction
of feeling is an intellectual fact, and the groundwork is intellectual
imagery."&mdash;Emotions, p. 63.</p></div>

to man" it must have been "to become a biped," says:
"The hands and arms could hardly have become perfect enough
to have manufactured weapons, or to have hurled stones and
spears with a true aim, as long as they were habitually used for
locomotion and for supporting the whole weight of the body; or,
as before remarked, as long as they were especially fitted for
climbing trees." The hands had to lose their dexterity for the
latter purposes before they could acquire the more delicate adjustments
necessary for skill in the former. The transition was
of course a gradual one; but the initial variations required would
seem to have been at first unfavourable to man's chances in the
struggle for existence, though it was through them that he rose
to his place at the summit of the organic scale.</p></div>

knowledge is worked out in an interesting way in Professor S. S.
